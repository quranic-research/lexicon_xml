								The twenty-eighth letter of the alphabet: called <foreign lang="ar">yaA='N</foreign>. It is one of the letters termed <hi>soft,</hi> or <hi>weak,</hi> and is a letter of prolongation and of augmentation. As a numeral it signifies <hi>Ten.</hi>

								<foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign> for <foreign lang="ar">yA</foreign> frequently occurs in the phrase <foreign lang="ar">yarasuwla A@ll~`hi</foreign>, and in <foreign lang="ar">yaA^ay~uhaA</foreign>.

								<foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign> with sheddeh followed by <foreign lang="ar">p</foreign> converts a part. n. into a quasi-inf. n., as <foreign lang="ar">AlmaDoruwbiy~apu</foreign>, “ the being beaten. ” So, by the relative <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign>, <foreign lang="ar">yaA='u Alnisobapi</foreign>, substs. and even particles are converted into abstract nouns of quality, as <foreign lang="ar">Aisomiy~apN</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">kayofiy~apN</foreign>.
						＝
						-A3-
								<foreign lang="ar">yaA</foreign> is the most common of vocative particles, used in calling to him who is near; [like <hi>O!</hi>]; and to him who is distant; [like <hi>Ho there! Holloa!</hi>]; and to him who is between near and distant; [like <hi>ho! what ho!</hi>]; (Ibn-el-Kátib, in the Káfiyeh, cited in TA, art. <foreign lang="ar">A^ayaA</foreign>.)
