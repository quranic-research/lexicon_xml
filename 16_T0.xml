								<foreign lang="ar">T</foreign>]: it is one of the letters termed <foreign lang="ar">majohuwrap</foreign> [or vocal, i. e. pronounced with the voice, and not with the breath only]; and of the letters termed <foreign lang="ar">niToEiy~ap</foreign>, like <foreign lang="ar">t</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">d</foreign>, because originating from the <foreign lang="ar">niToE</foreign> [q. v.] of the roof of the mouth.
