It is used to qualify a subst.; [governing (as a prefixed noun) the noun that follows it in the gen. case;] and when so used, it is put in the same case as the noun preceding it. (S.) It qualifies an indeterminate noun: (Mughnee, Msb:) you say <foreign lang="ar">jaA='aniY rajulN gayoruka</foreign> [<hi>A man, other than,</hi> or <hi>not, thou, came to me</hi>]: (Msb:) and <foreign lang="ar">naEomalo SaAliHFA</foreign> 
								<foreign lang="ar">gayora A@l~a*iY kun~aA naEomalu</foreign> [<hi>We will in that case do good, other than,</hi> or <hi>not, what we used to do:</hi> (Kur xxxv. 34:)]: (Mughnee:) and <foreign lang="ar">mino maA='K gayori A=sinK</foreign> [<hi>Of water other than,</hi> or <hi>not, altered in taste and colour</hi>]. (Kur xlvii. 16.) It is a noun necessarily prefixed, as to the sense, to a noun which it governs in the gen. case: but sometimes it is without the latter, when the meaning is understood and it is preceded by <foreign lang="ar">layosa</foreign>, (Mughnee, K,) or by <foreign lang="ar">laA</foreign>: (K:) [in which case it signifies <hi>Any other person</hi> or <hi>thing; any person</hi> or <hi>thing beside,</hi> or <hi>else:</hi>] you say <foreign lang="ar">qabaDotu Ea$arapF layosa gayoruhaA</foreign> [<hi>I received ten; not other than they</hi> was received by me; i. e., <hi>not any other thing;</hi> or <hi>not anything beside,</hi> or <hi>else</hi>]; (Mughnee, K;) the enunciative, <foreign lang="ar">maqobuwDFA</foreign>, being suppressed: (Mughnee:) and <foreign lang="ar">lys</foreign>

							It does not become determinate by its being prefixed to another noun, because it is very vague: but it is also applied as an epithet to a determinate noun which is near to being indeterminate; as in <foreign lang="ar">SiraATa</foreign> 
								<foreign lang="ar">A@l~a*iyna A^anoEamota Ealayohimo gayori A@lomagoDuwbi Ealayohimo</foreign> [<hi>The way of those upon whom Thou hast conferred favour; the other than,</hi> or <hi>those who are not, the objects of anger;</hi> (Kur i. 6 and 7;)] because the noun rendered determinate by the art. <foreign lang="ar">Al</foreign> denoting a genus is near to being indeterminate, and because when <foreign lang="ar">gyr</foreign> occurs between two contraries its vagueness becomes weakened, (Mughnee, K, *) or altogether departs: (K:) or it is here applied as an epithet to a determinate noun because it resembles a determinate noun in its being prefixed to such a noun: (Msb:) Az says that <foreign lang="ar">gyr</foreign> is here in the gen. case because it is an epithet to <foreign lang="ar">Al*yn</foreign>; and that it may be an epithet to [what is technically termed in this instance] a determinate noun [as having the article <foreign lang="ar">Al</foreign> prefixed to it] because <foreign lang="ar">Al*yn</foreign> has not [in itself] a direct meaning (<foreign lang="ar">liA^an~a Al~a*iyna</foreign> 
								<foreign lang="ar">gayoru maSomuwdK Samoduhu</foreign>), [it being merely a conjunct noun, the meaning of which is determined by what follows it,] notwithstanding it has the art. <foreign lang="ar">Al</foreign> prefixed to it: Abu-l-'Abbás says that Fr holds <foreign lang="ar">Al*yn</foreign> to have the office of an indeterminate noun; and <foreign lang="ar">gyr</foreign> to be an epithet of it; not of any other noun; but that <foreign lang="ar">gyr</foreign>, accord. to some, may be an epithet relating to the nouns implied in <foreign lang="ar">AnEmt</foreign> 
								<foreign lang="ar">Elyhm</foreign>, these not having a direct meaning: Akh says that <foreign lang="ar">gyr</foreign> [with what follows] is a substitute [for <foreign lang="ar">Al*yn</foreign> with what follows], as though the meaning were <foreign lang="ar">SiraATa gayori AlmagoDuwbi Ealayohimo</foreign> [<hi>the way</hi>
						<pb n="2316"/> 
								<hi>of those who are not the objects of anger</hi>]. (TA.) The reading <foreign lang="ar">gayora</foreign> is also related, on the authority of Ibn-Ketheer, in the accus. case, as a denotative of state, [meaning <hi>they being not the objects of anger,</hi>] relating to the pronoun governed in the gen. case by the prep. [in <foreign lang="ar">Elyhm</foreign>]; or by <foreign lang="ar">A^aEoniY</foreign> [<hi>I mean</hi>] understood; or as an exceptive, [accord. to a usage to be explained below,] if the favours be interpreted as conferred in common upon the two classes of persons. (Bd.)

						-b3-
							As it resembles a determinate noun in its being prefixed to a determinate noun, [as <foreign lang="ar">AlmgDwb</foreign> in the above-cited passage of the Kur,] some have presumed to prefix to it the article <foreign lang="ar">Al</foreign>: but against this it may be urged, that its prefixion to a determinate noun is not to render the expression determinate, but for specification; and <foreign lang="ar">Al</foreign> does not imply specification.

(Msb.) In the saying <foreign lang="ar">laA A_il`ha gayoru A@ll~`hi</foreign> [<hi>There is no deity other than God</hi>], <foreign lang="ar">gyr</foreign> is in the nom. case because it is the enunciative of <foreign lang="ar">lA</foreign>; but it may be put in the accus. case, as meaning <foreign lang="ar">A_il~aA</foreign>.
