(M.) It is a word, (M,) or particle, (T, S, Mughnee, K,) governing the gen. case: (S, M, Mughnee, K:) or a noun, (K, TA,) [i. e. an indecl. noun,] in the opinion of the Koofees and some others; but this opinion is rejected by Ibn-Málik in the Tesheel and its Expos., and by AHei, and by IHsh in the Mughnee. (TA.) Accord. to some, (K, TA,) it is used to denote a small number, (T, M, Msb, K, TA,) always, (TA,) or mostly: (Msb, TA:) [thus it may be rendered <hi>Few</hi> if we render the noun following it as a pl.; and <hi>scarce any</hi> if we render the noun following as a sing. or a pl.:] it is the <hi>contr. of</hi> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">kamo</foreign> when this latter is not used interrogatively: (T:) [and with <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign> affixed, restricting it from government, it may be rendered <hi>Few times,</hi> or <hi>seldom:</hi>] or it is used to denote a large number; (K, TA;) i. e. always: so says IDrst: (TA:) [thus used, but such is not always the case, it may be rendered <hi>Many,</hi> whether we render the noun following it as a sing. or as a pl.: and with <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign> affixed, <hi>Many times, many a time, oftentimes, ofttimes, often,</hi> or <hi>frequently:</hi>] or it is used to denote a small and a large number; (Mughnee, K;) often the latter, and seldom the former: (Mughnee:) or it is used in a case of boasting, or glorying, (K, TA,) exclusively of other cases, (TA,) to denote a large number: (K, TA:) or it does not denote by itself either a small number or a large number; but one or the other of these meanings is inferred from the context: (K:) [but sometimes neither of these meanings can be clearly inferred from the context: in these cases, it may be rendered <hi>Some:</hi> and with <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign> affixed, <hi>Sometimes:</hi>] accord. to Er-Radee, its primary meaning is to denote a small number, but it has been so much used to denote a large number as to be in this latter sense as though it were proper, and in the former sense as though it were tropical, requiring context [to explain it]. (Marginal note in my copy of the Mughnee.) [Without the affix <foreign lang="ar">mA</foreign>,] it governs an indeterminate noun (T, * S, Msb, Mughnee, K) only, (T, S, K,) and a pronoun. (S, M, Mughnee.) You say, <foreign lang="ar">rub~a yawomK bak~arotu fiyhi</foreign> [<hi>Few,</hi> or <hi>many, days have I gone forth early therein</hi>]: (T:) and <foreign lang="ar">rub~a rajulK qaAy^imN</foreign> [<hi>Few,</hi> or <hi>many, men are standing</hi>]: (M:) and <foreign lang="ar">rub~a rajulK qaAma</foreign> [<hi>Few,</hi> or <hi>many, men stood</hi>]: (Msb:) and in like manner, <foreign lang="ar">rajulK</foreign> ↓ 
      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">rub~ata</orth>; (Msb;) for the <foreign lang="ar">t</foreign> in this case is not a denotative of the fem. gender. (Msb.) The pronoun affixed to it is of the third pers., (S, M,) and is [generally] sing. and masc., (S, Mughnee,) though it may be followed by a fem. and by a dual and by a pl.: (S:) notwithstanding its being determinate in the utmost degree, its use in this manner is allowable because it resembles an indeterminate noun in its being used without the previous mention of the noun to which it relates; and hence it requires a noun to explain it: (IJ, M:) it annuls the government of <foreign lang="ar">rub~a</foreign>; (TA;) and the indeterminate noun that follows it is put in the accus. case as a specificative: (S, Mughnee:) thus you say, <foreign lang="ar">rub~ahu rajulFA qado Darabotu</foreign> [<hi>Few,</hi> or <hi>many, men I have beaten</hi>]: (S, M: *) but accord. to the Koofees, you say <foreign lang="ar">rub~ahu rajulFA</foreign>, (S,) and <foreign lang="ar">rub~ahaA A@moraA^apF</foreign>, (M,) and <foreign lang="ar">rub~ahumaA rajulayon$</foreign>, and <foreign lang="ar">rub~ahumo rijaAlFA</foreign>, and <foreign lang="ar">rub~ahun~a nisaA='F</foreign>: he who puts the pronoun in the sing. [in all cases] holds it to be allusive to something unknown; and he who does not put it in the sing. [when it is not followed by a sing. noun] holds it to be used in reply to a question, as though it were said to a man, “ Hast thou not any young women? ” and he answered, <foreign lang="ar">rub~ahun~a jawaArK qado malakotu</foreign> [<hi>Few,</hi> or <hi>many, young women have I possessed</hi>]: Ibn-Es-Sarráj says that the grammarians are as though they were of one consent in holding <foreign lang="ar">rub~a</foreign> to be a replicative [app. meaning in a case of this kind, with an affixed pronoun]: (S:) [but it is not always a replicative in a case of this kind; though perhaps it was originally:] AHeyth cites as an ex. <quote>
