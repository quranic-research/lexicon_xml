(Msb.) It is a noun of indication, [properly meaning <hi>This,</hi> but sometimes, when repeated, better rendered <hi>that,</hi>] relating to an object of the masc. gender, (S, M, K,) such as is near: (I'Ak p. 36:) or it relates to what is distant [accord. to some, and therefore should always be rendered <hi>that</hi>]; and <foreign lang="ar">h`*aA</foreign>, [which see in what follows,] to what is near: (K in art. <foreign lang="ar">haA</foreign>: [but the former is generally held to relate to what is near, like the latter:]) or it is a noun denoting anything indicated that is seen by the speaker and the person addressed: the noun in it is <foreign lang="ar">*a</foreign>, or <foreign lang="ar">*</foreign> alone: and it is a noun of which the signification is vague and unknown until it is explained by what follows it, as when you say <foreign lang="ar">*aA Alr~ajulu</foreign> [<hi>This man</hi>], and <foreign lang="ar">*aA Alfarasa</foreign> [<hi>This horse</hi>]: and the nom. and accus. and gen. are all alike: (T:) the fem. is <foreign lang="ar">*iY</foreign> (T, S, M, K, but omitted in the CK) and <foreign lang="ar">*iho</foreign>, (S, M, K, but omitted in the CK,) the latter used in the case of a pause, (S,) with a quiescent <foreign lang="ar">h</foreign>, which is a substitute for the <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign>, not a sign of the fem. gender, (S, M,) as it is in <foreign lang="ar">TaloHaho</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">Hamozaho</foreign>, in which it is changed into <foreign lang="ar">p</foreign> when followed by a conjunctive alif, for in this case the <foreign lang="ar">h</foreign> in <foreign lang="ar">*ih</foreign> remains unchanged [but is meksoorah, as it is also in other cases of connexion with a following word]; and one says also <foreign lang="ar">*hiY</foreign>; (M;) and <foreign lang="ar">taA</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">tiho</foreign>: (S and K &amp;c. in art. <foreign lang="ar">tA</foreign>:) for the dual you say <foreign lang="ar">*aAni</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">taAni</foreign>; (M;) <foreign lang="ar">*aAni</foreign> is the dual form of <foreign lang="ar">*aA</foreign> (T, S) [and <foreign lang="ar">taAni</foreign> is that of <foreign lang="ar">taA</foreign> used in the place of <foreign lang="ar">*iY</foreign>]; i. e., you indicate the masc. dual by <foreign lang="ar">*aAni</foreign> in the nom. case, and <foreign lang="ar">*ayoni</foreign> in the accus. and gen.; and the fem. dual you indicate by <foreign lang="ar">taAni</foreign> in the nom. case, and <foreign lang="ar">tayoni</foreign> in the accus. and gen.: (I'Ak p. 36:) the pl. is <foreign lang="ar">A^ulaA='i</foreign> [or <foreign lang="ar">A^ulaA='i</foreign>] (T, S, and I'Ak ib.) in the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz, (I'Ak,) and <foreign lang="ar">A^uwlaY</foreign> [or <foreign lang="ar">A^ulaY</foreign>] (T, I'Ak) in the dial. of Temeem; each both masc. and fem. (I'Ak ib. [See art. <foreign lang="ar">AlY</foreign>.]) You say, <foreign lang="ar">*aA A^axuwka</foreign> [<hi>This is thy brother</hi>]: and <foreign lang="ar">*iYA^uxotuka</foreign> [<hi>This is thy sister</hi>]: (T:) and <foreign lang="ar">laAA=tiyka fiY *iY Als~anapi</foreign> [<hi>I will not come to thee in this year</hi>]; like as you say <foreign lang="ar">fY h`*ihi Als~anapi</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">fY h`*iY Als~anapi</foreign>; not <foreign lang="ar">fY *aA Als~anapi</foreign>, because <foreign lang="ar">*A</foreign> is always masc.

                  <foreign lang="ar">A^axawaAtuka</foreign> [<hi>These are thy sisters</hi>]: thus making no difference between the masc. and the fem. in the pl. (T.) ―         -b2-  The <foreign lang="ar">haA</foreign> that is used to give notice, to a person addressed, of something about to be said to him, is prefixed to <foreign lang="ar">*aA</foreign> [and to <foreign lang="ar">*iY</foreign> &amp;c.], (T, S, M, K,) and is a particle without any meaning but inception: (T:) thus you say <foreign lang="ar">h`*aA</foreign>, (T, S, M,) and some say <foreign lang="ar">h`*aAA</foreign>, adding another <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign>; (Ks, T;) fem. <foreign lang="ar">h`*iY</foreign>, (T, S, M,) and [more commonly] <foreign lang="ar">h`*iho</foreign> in the case of a pause, (M,) and <foreign lang="ar">h`*ihi</foreign> in other cases, (T, S,) and <foreign lang="ar">haAtaA</foreign>, and some say <foreign lang="ar">h`*aAti</foreign>, but this is unusual and disapproved: (T:) dual <foreign lang="ar">h`*aAni</foreign> for the masc., and <foreign lang="ar">haAtaAni</foreign> for the fem.; (T;) said by IJ to be not properly duals, but nouns formed to denote duals; (M;) and many of the Arabs say <foreign lang="ar">h`*aAn~i</foreign>; (T;) some, also, make <foreign lang="ar">h`*aAni</foreign> indecl., like the sing. <foreign lang="ar">*aA</foreign>, reading [in the Kur xx. 66] <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a h`*aAni</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">lasaAHiraAni</foreign> [<hi>Verily these two are enchanters</hi>], and it has been said that this is of the dial. of Belhárith [or Benu-l-Hárith] Ibn-Kaab; but others make it decl., reading <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a h`*aAyoni lasaAHiraAni</foreign>: (S, TA: [see, however, what has been said respecting this phrase voce <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a</foreign>:]) the pl. is <foreign lang="ar">h`w^ulaA</foreign> in the dial. of Temeem, with a quiescent <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign>; and <foreign lang="ar">h`w^ulaA='i</foreign> in the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz, with medd and hemz and khafd; and <foreign lang="ar">h`w^ulaA='K</foreign> in the dial. of Benoo- 'Okeyl, with medd and hemz and tenween. (AZ, T.) The Arabs also say, <foreign lang="ar">laA haA A@ll~`hi *aA</foreign>, introducing the name of God between <foreign lang="ar">haA</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">*aA</foreign>; meaning <hi>No, by God; this</hi> is [my oath, or] that by which I swear.

                  </quote> [it is said that] <foreign lang="ar">ha*aA</foreign> is for <foreign lang="ar">A^a*aA</foreign>, (M,) i. e., <foreign lang="ar">h</foreign> is here substituted for the interrogative hemzeh (S * and K in art. <foreign lang="ar">hA</foreign>) [so that the meaning is, <hi>And her female companions came, and said, Is this he who gave love to other than us, and treated us unkindly?</hi>]: or, as some assert, <foreign lang="ar">ha*aA</foreign> is here used for <foreign lang="ar">h`*aA</foreign>, the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> being suppressed for the sake of the measure. (El-Bedr El-Karáfee, TA in art. <foreign lang="ar">hA</foreign>.) ―         -b3-  One says also <foreign lang="ar">*aAka</foreign>, (T, S, M, K,) affixing to <foreign lang="ar">*aA</foreign> the <foreign lang="ar">k</foreign> of allocution, [q. v., meaning <hi>That,</hi>] relating to an object that is distant, (T, *, S, and I'Ak p. 36,) or, accord. to general opinion, to that which occupies a middle place between the near and the distant, (I'Ak pp. 36 and 37,) and this <foreign lang="ar">k</foreign> has no place in desinential syntax; (S, and I'Ak p. 36;) it does not occupy the place of a gen. nor of an accus., but is only affixed to <foreign lang="ar">*A</foreign> to denote the distance of <foreign lang="ar">*A</foreign> from the person addressed: (T:) for the fem. you say <foreign lang="ar">tiyka</foreign> (T, S) and <foreign lang="ar">taAka</foreign>; (S and K in art. <foreign lang="ar">tA</foreign>, q. v.;) but not <foreign lang="ar">*iyka</foreign>, for this is wrong, (T, S,) and is used only by the vulgar: (T:) for the dual you say <foreign lang="ar">*aAnika</foreign> (T, S) and <foreign lang="ar">*ayonika</foreign>, as in the phrases <foreign lang="ar">jaA='aniY *aAnika Alr~ajulaAni</foreign> [<hi>Those two men came to me</hi>] and <foreign lang="ar">raA^ayotu *ayonuka Alr~ajulayoni</foreign>, [<hi>I saw those two men</hi>]; (S;) and some say <foreign lang="ar">*aAn~ika</foreign>, with teshdeed, (T, S,) [accord. to J] for the purpose of corroboration, and to add to the letters of the noun, (S,) but [accord. to others] this is dual of <foreign lang="ar">*`lika</foreign>, [which see in what follows,] the second <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign> being a substitute for the <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign>; (T on the authority of Zj and others;) and some say <foreign lang="ar">taAn~ika</foreign> also, with tesh-deed, (T, S,) as well as <foreign lang="ar">taAnika</foreign>: (T in this art., and S and K in art. <foreign lang="ar">tA</foreign>, but there omitted in some copies of the S:) the pl. is [<foreign lang="ar">A^uwlaAka</foreign> and] <foreign lang="ar">A^uwl`y^ika</foreign>. (T, S.) <foreign lang="ar">haA</foreign> is also prefixed to <foreign lang="ar">*aAka</foreign>; so that you say, <foreign lang="ar">h`*aAka zayodN</foreign> [<hi>That is Zeyd</hi>]: (S, TA:) and in like manner, for the fem., you say <foreign lang="ar">haAtiyka</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">haAtaAka</foreign>: (S and K in art. <foreign lang="ar">tA</foreign>:) but it is not prefixed [to the dual nor] to <foreign lang="ar">A^uwl`y^ika</foreign>. (S.) ―         -b4-  You also add <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign> in <foreign lang="ar">*aAka</foreign>, (T, S, M, K,) as a corroborative; (TA;) so that you say <foreign lang="ar">*`lika</foreign>, [meaning <hi>That,</hi>] (T, S, M, K,) relating to an object that is distant, by common consent; (I'Ak pp. 36 and 37;) or hemzeh, saying <foreign lang="ar">*aAy^ika</foreign>, (K,) but some say that this is a <pb n="948"/> mispronunciation: (TA in art. <foreign lang="ar">*wY</foreign>:) for the fem. you say <foreign lang="ar">tiloka</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">taAlika</foreign>: the dual of <foreign lang="ar">*`lika</foreign> is <foreign lang="ar">*aAn~ika</foreign>, mentioned above; and that of the fem. is <foreign lang="ar">vaAn~ika</foreign>: (T: [and in the K in art. <foreign lang="ar">tA</foreign>, <foreign lang="ar">taAlika</foreign> is also mentioned as a dual, as well as a sing.:]) and the pl. is <foreign lang="ar">A^uwlaAlika</foreign>. (S and M and K voce <foreign lang="ar">A^uwlaY</foreign> or <foreign lang="ar">A^ulaY</foreign> or <foreign lang="ar">A^ulaA</foreign>. [See art. <foreign lang="ar">AlY</foreign>.]) <foreign lang="ar">haA</foreign> is not prefixed to <foreign lang="ar">*`lika</foreign> (S) nor to <foreign lang="ar">tiloka</foreign> [nor to <foreign lang="ar">A^uwlaAlika</foreign>] because, as IB says, the <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign> denotes the remoteness of that which is indicated and the <foreign lang="ar">hA</foreign> denotes its nearness, so that the two are incompatible. (TA in art. <foreign lang="ar">tA</foreign>.) ―         -b5-  In the saying in the Kur [ii. 256, the Verse of the Throne], <foreign lang="ar">mano *aA Al~a*iY ya$ofaEu Einodahu A_il~aA biA_i*onihi</foreign>, (T, TA,) accord. to Th and Mbr, (TA,) <foreign lang="ar">h`*aA</foreign> is <hi>syn. with</hi> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">*A</foreign> [so that the meaning is, <hi>Who is this that shall intercede with Him but by his permission?</hi>]: (T, TA:) or it may be here redundant [so that the meaning is, <hi>Who is he that &amp;c.?</hi>]. (Kull.) ―         -b6-  It is sometimes <hi>syn. with</hi> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">Aal~a*iY</foreign>. (T, S, M.) So in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">maA *aA raA^ayota</foreign> [<hi>What is it that thou sawest?</hi>]; to which one may answer, <foreign lang="ar">mataAEN HasanN</foreign> [A goodly commodity]. (Sb, S.) And so in the Kur [ii. 216], <foreign lang="ar">wa yasoA^aluwnaka maA maA *aA yunofiquwna</foreign> [<hi>And they ask thee what</hi> amount of their property <hi>is it that they shall expend</hi> in alms]; (T, M, TA;) accord. to those who make the reply to be in the nom. case; for this shows that <foreign lang="ar">mA</foreign> is [virtually] in the nom. case as an inchoative, and <foreign lang="ar">*A</foreign> is its enunciative, and <foreign lang="ar">ynfqwn</foreign> is the complement of <foreign lang="ar">*A</foreign>; and that <foreign lang="ar">mA</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">*A</foreign> are not to be regarded as one word: [or] this is the preferable way of explanation in the opinion of Sb, though he allowed the other way, [that of regarding <foreign lang="ar">mA</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">*A</foreign> as one word, together constituting an inchoative, and <foreign lang="ar">ynfqwn</foreign> as its enunciative, (see Ham p. 521,)] with [the reply in] the nom. case: (M:) and <foreign lang="ar">h`*aA</foreign>, also, is used in the same sense: (TA:) so too <foreign lang="ar">*A</foreign> in <foreign lang="ar">maA *aA huwa</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">mano *aA huwa</foreign> may be considered as <hi>syn. with</hi> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">Al*Y</foreign>; but it is preferable to regard it as redundant. (Kull.) ―         -b7-  It is [said to be] redundant also in other instances: for ex., in the trad. of Jereer, as related by Aboo-'Amr Ez-Záhid, who says that it is so in this instance: <foreign lang="ar">yaToluEu Ealayokumo</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">rajulN mino *iY yamanK EalaY wajohihi masoHapN mino *iY mulokK</foreign> [<hi>There will come to you a man from El-Yemen, having upon his face an indication of dominion</hi>]. (TA. [But this evidently belongs to art. <foreign lang="ar">*uw</foreign>; in which see a similar ex. (<foreign lang="ar">A^atayonaA *aA yamanK</foreign>). See also other exs. there.]) ―         -b8-  [<foreign lang="ar">ka*aA</foreign> lit. means <hi>Like this:</hi> and hence, <hi>thus:</hi> as also <foreign lang="ar">h`ka*aA</foreign>. ―         -b9-  It is also often used as one word, and, as such, is made the complement of a prefixed noun; as in <foreign lang="ar">sanapa ka*aA</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">fiY sanapi ka*aA</foreign>

(M.) ―         -b14-  <foreign lang="ar">*aAtN</foreign> is sometimes used as a noun independent in its meaning, (Mgh, Msb,) so as to denote material [or real] things; (Msb;) and is described by the epithets <foreign lang="ar">mutamay~izapN</foreign> [or “ distinct ”] (Mgh, Msb) and <foreign lang="ar">qadiymapN</foreign> [as meaning “ that has existed from eternity ”] (Mgh) and <foreign lang="ar">muHodavapN</foreign> [as meaning “ that has been brought into existence ”]. (Mgh, Msb.) Thus used, (Msb,) it signifies The <hi>essence</hi> of a thing, meaning <hi>that by being which a thing is what it is,</hi> or <hi>that in being which a thing consists;</hi> or the <hi>ultimate and radical constituent</hi> of a thing: and the <hi>essence</hi> as meaning the <hi>peculiar nature</hi> of a thing: syn. <foreign lang="ar">HaqiyqapN</foreign>, (T, IB, Msb, TA,) and <foreign lang="ar">maAhiy~apN</foreign>, (Msb,) and <foreign lang="ar">xaAS~apN</foreign>: (T, IB, TA:) it is also used as meaning a thing's <hi>self:</hi> (Mgh, * Msb:) [a man's <hi>self,</hi> or <hi>person:</hi> (see <foreign lang="ar">$axoSN</foreign>:)] and <hi>a thing; a being; anything, whatever it be;</hi> every <foreign lang="ar">$aYo'</foreign> being a <foreign lang="ar">*aAt</foreign>, and every <foreign lang="ar">*At</foreign> being a <foreign lang="ar">$Y'</foreign>: (Aboo-Sa'eed, Mgh, Msb:) and particularly <hi>a substance,</hi> or <hi>thing that subsists by itself:</hi> [hence <foreign lang="ar">Aisomu *aAtK</foreign> meaning <hi>a real substantive;</hi> also termed <foreign lang="ar">Aisomu EayonK</foreign>: opposed to <foreign lang="ar">Aisomu maEonFY</foreign>, i. e. an ideal substantive:] and [hence] it signifies also <hi>a word that is independent in its meaning;</hi> [i. e. <foreign lang="ar">*aAtN</foreign> (alone), though oftener used in the sense assigned above to <foreign lang="ar">Aisomu *aAtK</foreign>, signifies also, absolutely, <hi>a substantive;</hi>] opposed to <foreign lang="ar">SifapN</foreign> as signifying a word that is not independent in its meaning. (Kull p. 187.) Its application to God, in the sense of <foreign lang="ar">HaqiyqapN</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">xaAS~apN</foreign>, is forbidden by most persons: (TA:) [for] <foreign lang="ar">*aAtu A@ll~`hi</foreign> [as meaning <hi>The essence of God</hi>], used by the scholastic theologians, is said to be an ignorant expression, because the names of God do not admit the fem. affix <foreign lang="ar">p</foreign>; so that one does not apply to Him the epithet <foreign lang="ar">Eal~aAmapN</foreign>, though He is the all-surpassing in knowledge. (Msb.) The phrase <foreign lang="ar">fiY *aAti A@ll~`hi</foreign> is like <foreign lang="ar">fiY janobi A@ll~`hi</foreign> [<hi>In,</hi> or <hi>in respect of, that which is the right,</hi> or <hi>due, of God;</hi> or <hi>in,</hi> or <hi>in respect of, obedience to God,</hi> or <hi>the means of obtaining nearness to God,</hi> or <hi>the way of God</hi>]: and like <foreign lang="ar">liwajohi A@ll~`hi</foreign> [<hi>for the sake of God;</hi> or <hi>to obtain the countenance,</hi> or <hi>favour,</hi> or <hi>approbation,</hi> or <hi>recompense, of God</hi>]: (Msb:) or it means <hi>in obedience to God;</hi> and <hi>in the way of God</hi> or <hi>his religion:</hi> (TA:) [or it may be rendered <hi>for the sake of God Himself;</hi> and so <pb n="986"/>
