ORIGINAL FILES - DO NOT CHANGE

These are the original xml-files (issued on 07.04.2011) which were downloaded from: 
http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/opensource/downloads/texts/hopper-texts-Arabic.tar.gz
Subfolder: /Arabic/Lane/opensource

These original files were renamed as per the following convention (as it is required for this project):
1. A leading two digit number was added that reflects the sequence (01 to 28) of the arabic letter (as used in the lexicon).
2. The number is followed by an underscore (if not already part of the original filename) 
	and then by the original file name except for the following three special cases:
	- 	_0 (as _*0 could not be used in a filename) was changed to 09_c0 (for Dhal)
	- 	$0 was changed to 13_X0 (for Sheen)
	- 	Y was changed to 28_y (for Yeh)

THESE FILES ARE ONLY PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE AND MUST NOT BE CHANGED
