PROJECT BASIS - DO NOT CHANGE

These are the modified files which were downloaded from: 
https://github.com/laneslexicon/lexicon_xml
Branch: master - Released on 05.Feb 2016
All modifications from the original version are described in this repository.

The files were renamed as per the following convention (as required for this project):
1. A leading two digit number was added that reflects the sequence (01 to 28) of the arabic character (as used in the lexicon).
2. The number is followed by an underscore (if not already part of the original filename) 
	and then by the original file name except for the following three special cases:
	- 	_0 (as _*0 could not be used in a filename) was changed to 09_c0 (for Dhal)
	- 	$0 was changed to 13_X0 (for Sheen)
	- 	Y was changed to 28_y (for Yeh)

THESE FILES ARE ONLY PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE AND MUST NOT BE CHANGED
