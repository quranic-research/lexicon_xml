                  <hi>The second letter of the alphabet:</hi> called <foreign lang="ar">baA='N</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">baA</foreign>; (TA in <foreign lang="ar">bAb AlAlf Ally~np</foreign>;) the latter of which forms is used in spelling; like as are its analogues, as <foreign lang="ar">tA</foreign> [and <foreign lang="ar">vA</foreign>] and <foreign lang="ar">HA</foreign> [and <foreign lang="ar">xA</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">rA</foreign>] and <foreign lang="ar">TA</foreign> [and <foreign lang="ar">ZA</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">fA</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">hA</foreign>] and <foreign lang="ar">yA</foreign>; because in this case they are not generally regarded as nouns, but as mere sounds: (Sb, M:) [these are generally pronounced with imáleh, i. e. bé, té, &amp;c., with the exception of <foreign lang="ar">HA</foreign>, <foreign lang="ar">xA</foreign>, <foreign lang="ar">TA</foreign>, and <foreign lang="ar">ZA</foreign>; and when they are regarded as nouns, their duals are <foreign lang="ar">bayaAni</foreign>, <foreign lang="ar">tayaAni</foreign>, &amp;c.:] the pl. of <foreign lang="ar">baA='N</foreign> is <foreign lang="ar">baA='aAtN</foreign>; and that of <foreign lang="ar">baA</foreign> is <foreign lang="ar">A^abowaA='N</foreign> (TA ubi suprà.) It is one of the letters termed <foreign lang="ar">majohuwrah</foreign> [or vocal, i. e. pronounced with the voice, and not with the breath only]; and of those termed <foreign lang="ar">$afahiy~ap</foreign> [or labial]; and of those termed <foreign lang="ar">*uloq</foreign> [or pronounced with the extremity of the tongue or the lips]: Kh says that the letters of the second and third classes above mentioned [the latter of which comprises the former] are those composing the words <foreign lang="ar">rub~a mano</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">laf~a</foreign>; and on account of their easiness of utterance, they abound in the composition of words, so that no perfect quinqueliteral-radical word is without one or more of them, unless it is of the class termed <foreign lang="ar">muwal~ad</foreign>, not of the classical language of the Arabs. (TA at the commencement of <foreign lang="ar">bAb</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">AlbA='</foreign>.) ―         -b2-  In the dial. of Mázin, it is changed into <foreign lang="ar">m</foreign>; (TA ubi suprà;) as in <foreign lang="ar">bak~apu</foreign>, which thus becomes <foreign lang="ar">mak~apu</foreign> [the town of Mekkeh]. (TA in <foreign lang="ar">bAb AlAlf</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">Ally~np</foreign>.)       -A2-  <foreign lang="ar">bi</foreign> is a preposition, or particle governing the gen. case; (S, Mughnee, K;) having kesr for its invariable termination because it is impossible to begin with a letter after which one makes a pause; (S;) or, correctly speaking, having a vowel for its invariable termination because it is impossible to begin with a quiescent letter; and having kesr, not fet-h, to make it accord with its government [of the gen. case], and to distinguish between it and that which is both a noun and a particle. (IB.) It is used to denote adhesion (Sb, T, S, M, Mughnee, K) of the verb to its objective complement, (S,) or of a noun or verb to that to which it is itself prefixed; (TA;) and adjunction, or association: (Sb, T:) and some say that its meaning of denoting adhesion is inseparable from it; and therefore Sb restricted himself to the mention of this meaning: (Mughnee:) or Sb says that its primary meaning is that of denoting adhesion and mixture. (Ibn-Es-Sáïgh, quoted in a marginal note in a copy of the Mughnee.) It denotes adhesion [&amp;c.] in the proper sense; (Mughnee, K;) as in <foreign lang="ar">A^amosakotu bizayodK</foreign>, (M, Mughnee, K,) meaning <hi>I laid hold upon,</hi> or <hi>seized, [Zeyd,</hi> or] <hi>somewhat of the body of Zeyd,</hi> or <hi>what might detain him, as an arm or a hand, or a garment, and the like;</hi> whereas <foreign lang="ar">A^amosakotuhu</foreign> may mean I withheld him, or restrained him, from acting according to his own free will: (Mughnee:) and it denotes the same in a tropical sense; (Mughnee, K;) as in <foreign lang="ar">mararotu</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">bizayodK</foreign> [<hi>I passed by Zeyd</hi>]; (S, Mughnee, K;) as though meaning <hi>I made my passing to adhere to Zeyd;</hi> (S;) or <hi>I made my passing to adhere to a place near to Zeyd:</hi> accord. to Akh, it is for <foreign lang="ar">mararotu EalaYi zayodK</foreign>; but <foreign lang="ar">mararotu bihi</foreign> is more common than <foreign lang="ar">mararotu Ealayohi</foreign>, and is therefore more properly regarded as the original form of expression: (Mughnee:) accord. to F, the vowel of this preposition is kesr [when it is prefixed to a noun or a pronoun]; or, as some say, it is fet-h when it is with a noun properly so called; as in <foreign lang="ar">mar~a bazayodK</foreign>: so in the K; this being the reverse of what they have prescribed in the case of [the preposition] <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign>: but in the case of <foreign lang="ar">b</foreign>, no vowel but kesr is known. (MF.) It denotes the same in the saying <foreign lang="ar">bihi daA='N</foreign> [<hi>In him is a disease;</hi> i. e. a <hi>disease is cleaving to him</hi>]: and so [accord. to some] in <foreign lang="ar">A^aqosamotu bA@ll~`hi</foreign> [<hi>I swore,</hi> or, emphatically, <hi>I swear, by God;</hi> and similar phrases, respecting which see a later division of this paragraph]. (L.) So, too, in <foreign lang="ar">A^a$oraka bA@ll~`hi</foreign>, because meaning <hi>He associated another with God:</hi> and in <foreign lang="ar">wak~alotu bifulaAnK</foreign>, meaning <hi>I associated a</hi> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">wakiyl</foreign> [or <hi>factor</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>with such a one.</hi> (T.) [And so in other phrases here following.] <foreign lang="ar">Ealayoka bizayodK</foreign> 
                  <hi>Keep thou to Zeyd:</hi> or <hi>take thou Zeyd.</hi> (TA voce <foreign lang="ar">EalaY</foreign>.) <foreign lang="ar">Ealayoka bika*aA</foreign> 
                  <hi>Keep thou to such a thing:</hi> (El-Munáwee:) or <hi>take thou such a thing.</hi> (Ham p. 216.) <foreign lang="ar">fabahaA wanaEomato</foreign> 
                  <hi>Keep thou to it,</hi> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">fbhA</foreign> meaning <foreign lang="ar">faEalayoka bihaA</foreign>, (Mgh in art. <foreign lang="ar">nEm</foreign>,) [or <hi>let him keep to it,</hi> i. e. <foreign lang="ar">faEalayohi bihaA</foreign>,] or <hi>thou hast taken to,</hi> or <hi>adopted and followed,</hi> or <hi>adhered to, the established way,</hi> or <hi>the way established by the Prophet,</hi> i. e. <foreign lang="ar">fabiA@ls~un~api A^axa*ata</foreign>, (Mgh,) or <hi>he hath taken to,</hi> &amp;c., i. e. <foreign lang="ar">fabiA@ls~un~api A^axa*a</foreign>, (IAth, TA in art. <foreign lang="ar">nEm</foreign>,) or <hi>by this practice,</hi> or <hi>action, is excellence attained,</hi> or <hi>he will attain excellence,</hi> i. e. <foreign lang="ar">fabih`*ihi AlxaSolapi A^awi AlfaEolapi yunaAlu AlfaDolu</foreign>,  or <foreign lang="ar">yanaAlu</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">AlfaDola</foreign>; (IAth ubi suprà;) <hi>and excellent is the practise, the established way,</hi> or <hi>the way established by the Prophet,</hi> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">wnEmt</foreign> meaning <foreign lang="ar">waniEomati</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">AlxaSolapu Als~un~apu</foreign>, (Mgh,) or <hi>and excellent is the practice,</hi> or <hi>the action,</hi> i. e. <foreign lang="ar">waniEomati AlxaSolapu</foreign>, (S and K in art. <foreign lang="ar">nEm</foreign>,) or <foreign lang="ar">waniEomati AlxaSolapu A^uwi AlfaEolapu</foreign>: (IAth ubi suprà:) and it also occurs in a trad., where the meaning is [He who hath done such a thing <hi>hath adhered to the ordinance of indulgence; and excellent is the practice,</hi> or <hi>action,</hi> &amp;c.: for here <foreign lang="ar">fbhA</foreign> is meant to imply] <foreign lang="ar">fabiA@lr~axoSapi</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">A^axa*a</foreign>. (TA in the present art. See also art. <foreign lang="ar">nEm</foreign>.) ―         -b2-  It is also used to render a verb transitive; (Mughnee, K;) having the same effect as hemzeh [prefixed], in causing [what would otherwise be] the agent to become an objective complement; as in <foreign lang="ar">*ahabotu bizayodK</foreign> syn. with <foreign lang="ar">A^a*ohabotuhu</foreign> [<hi>I made Zeyd to go away;</hi> or <hi>I took him away</hi>]; (Mughnee;) and hence, [in the Kur ii. 16,] <foreign lang="ar">*ahaba A@ll~`hu binuwrihimo</foreign> [<hi>God taketh away their light</hi>]; (Mughnee, K;) which refutes the assertion of Mbr and Suh, that <foreign lang="ar">*ahabotu bizayodK</foreign> means [<hi>I went away with Zeyd;</hi> i. e.] <hi>I accompanied Zeyd in going away.</hi> (Mughnee.) J says that any verb that is not trans. you may render so by means of <foreign lang="ar">bi</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> [prefixed] and reduplication [of the medial radical letter]: you say, <foreign lang="ar">TaAra bihi</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">A^aTaArahu</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">Tay~arahu</foreign> [as meaning <hi>He made him to fly,</hi> or <hi>to fly away</hi>]: but IB says that this is not correct as of common application; for some verbs are rendered trans. by means of hemzeh, but not by reduplication; and some by reduplication, but not by hemzeh; and some by <foreign lang="ar">b</foreign>, but not by hemzeh nor by reduplication: you say, <foreign lang="ar">dafaEotu zayodFA biEamorKw</foreign> [as meaning <hi>I made ' Amr to repel Zeyd,</hi> lit. <hi>I repelled Zeyd by ' Amr</hi>], but not <foreign lang="ar">A^adofaEotuhu</foreign> nor <foreign lang="ar">daf~aEotuhu</foreign>. (TA.) ―         -b3-  It also denotes the employing a thing as an aid or instrument; (S, M, * Mughnee, K; *) as in <foreign lang="ar">katabotu biAlqalami</foreign> [<hi>I wrote with the reed-pen</hi>]; (S, Mughnee, K;) and <foreign lang="ar">najarotu biAlqaduwmi</foreign> [<hi>I worked as a carpenter with the adz</hi>]; (Mughnee, K;) and <foreign lang="ar">Darabotu bAls~ayofi</foreign> [<hi>I struck with the sword</hi>]. (M.) And hence the <foreign lang="ar">bi</foreign> in <foreign lang="ar">bisomi A@ll~`hi</foreign>, (Mughnee, K,) accord. to some, because the action [before which it is pronounced] is not practicable in the most perfect manner but by means of it: (Mughnee:) but others disallow this, because the name of God should not be regarded as an instrument: (MF, TA:) and some say that the <foreign lang="ar">b</foreign> here is to denote beginning, as though one said, <foreign lang="ar">A^abotadaA^u</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">bisomi A@ll~`hi</foreign> [<hi>I begin with the name of God</hi>]. (TA.) ―         -b4-  It also denotes a cause; as in <foreign lang="ar">A_in~akumo Zalamotumo</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">A^anofusakumo biA@t~ixaA*ikumu A@loEijola</foreign> [<hi>Verily ye have wronged yourselves by,</hi> i. e. <hi>because of, your taking to yourselves the calf as a god</hi> (Kur ii. 51)]; and in <foreign lang="ar">fakul~FA A^axa*onaA bi*anobihi</foreign> [<hi>And every one of these we have punished for,</hi> i. e. <hi>because of, his sin</hi> (Kur xxix. 39)]; (Mughnee, K) and in <foreign lang="ar">lano yadoxula</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">A^aHadakumu Aljan~apa biEamalihi</foreign> [<hi>Not any of you shall enter Paradise by,</hi> or <hi>for,</hi> or <hi>because of, his works</hi>]. (TA from a trad.) And so in <foreign lang="ar">laqaytu bizayodK AlA^asada</foreign> 
                  <hi>I met,</hi> or <hi>found, by reason of</hi> my meeting, or finding, <hi>Zeyd, the lion:</hi> (Mughnee:) or the <foreign lang="ar">b</foreign> in this instance denotes comparison; [i. e. <hi>I met,</hi> or <hi>found, in Zeyd</hi> the like of <hi>the lion;</hi>] as also in <foreign lang="ar">raA^ayotu bifulaAnK Alqamara</foreign> [<hi>I saw in such a one the</hi> 
                  <pb n="142"/> like of <hi>the moon</hi>]. (TA.) Another ex. of the same usage is the saying [of a poet], <quote>

(Mughnee. See also another reading of this verse voce <foreign lang="ar">naArN</foreign>.) [In like manner] it is used in the sense of <foreign lang="ar">mino A^ajoli</foreign> [which means <foreign lang="ar">bisababi</foreign> (Msb in art. <foreign lang="ar">Ajl</foreign>)] in the saying of Lebeed, <quote>

(EM pp. 174 and 175.) It is also used to denote a cause when prefixed to <foreign lang="ar">A^an~a</foreign> and to <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign> as in <foreign lang="ar">*`lika biA^an~ahumo kaAnuwA yakofuruwna biA=yaAti A@ll~`hi</foreign> [<hi>That was because they used to disbelieve in the signs of God</hi>]; and in <foreign lang="ar">*`lika bimaA EaSawoA</foreign> [<hi>That was because they disobeyed</hi>]: both instances in the Kur ii. 58. (Bd.) ―         -b5-  It is also used to denote concomitance, as <hi>syn. with</hi> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">maEa</foreign>; (Mughnee, K;) as in <foreign lang="ar">Ai$otarayotu</foreign>

(Bd.) Authors differ respecting the <foreign lang="ar">b</foreign> in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">fasab~iHo biHamodi rab~ika</foreign>, in the Kur [xv. 98 and ex. 3]; some saying that it denotes concomitance, and that <foreign lang="ar">Hmd</foreign> is prefixed to the objective complement, so that the meaning is, <foreign lang="ar">sab~iHohN HaAmidFA lahu</foreign> [<hi>Declare thou his (thy Lord's) freedom from everything derogatory from his glory, praising Him</hi>], i. e. declare thou his freedom from that which is not suitable to Him, and ascribe to Him that which is suitable to Him; but others say that it denotes the employing a thing as an aid or instrument, and that <foreign lang="ar">Hmd</foreign> is prefixed to the agent, so that the meaning is, <foreign lang="ar">sab~iHohu bimaA Hamida bihi nafosahu</foreign> [<hi>declare thou his (thy Lord's) freedom from everything derogatory from his glory by means of</hi> ascribing to Him <hi>that wherewith He hath praised himself</hi>]: and so, too, respecting the saying, <foreign lang="ar">suboHaAnaka A@ll~`hum~a wabiHamodika</foreign>; some asserting that it is one proposition, the, being redundant; but others saying, it is two propositions, the <foreign lang="ar">w</foreign> being a conjunction, and the verb upon which the <foreign lang="ar">b</foreign> is dependent being suppressed, so that the meaning is, [<hi>I declare thy freedom from everything derogatory from thy glory, 0 God,</hi>] <foreign lang="ar">wabiHamodika sab~aHotuka</foreign> [<hi>and with the praising of Thee,</hi> or <hi>by means of the praise that belongeth to Thee, I declare thy freedom</hi> &amp;c.].

[Other explanations of these two phrases have been proposed; but those given above are the most approved.]) You also say, <foreign lang="ar">EalaY~a bihi</foreign>, meaning <hi>Bring thou him,</hi> [i. e.] <hi>come with him, to me.</hi> (Har p. 109.) <foreign lang="ar">DaAqato Ealayohimu</foreign>

                  <foreign lang="ar">minohu A^asadFA</foreign>; and this is plain with respect to the former ex., but not with respect to the second; for the negation of attributes of dispraise denoted as intensive in degree does not involve the negation of what is simply essential in those attributes; and one does not say, <foreign lang="ar">laqiytu minohu A^asadFA</foreign>, or <foreign lang="ar">baHorFA</foreign>, [or <foreign lang="ar">raA^ayotu minohu A^asadFA</foreign>, as above, or <foreign lang="ar">baHorFA</foreign>,] but when meaning to express an intensive degree of boldness, or of generosity.

                  <foreign lang="ar">SaAHibuhaA</foreign> [<hi>I am the doer of it! I am the doer of it!</hi>]. (Sh, T.)

(T.) And in another, he is related to have said to a woman brought to him for having committed adultery or fornication, <foreign lang="ar">mano biki</foreign>, meaning <foreign lang="ar">mano SaAHibuki</foreign> [<hi>Who was thine accomplice?</hi>]: (T:) or <foreign lang="ar">mani AlfaAEilu biki</foreign> [<hi>Who was the agent with thee?</hi>]. (TA.) <foreign lang="ar">A^anaA bika</foreign>

One says also, <foreign lang="ar">mano liY bika*aA</foreign>, meaning <hi>Who will be responsible, answerable, amenable,</hi> or <hi>surety, to me for such a thing?</hi> (Har p. 126: and the like is said in p. 191.) And similar to this is the saying, <foreign lang="ar">kaA^an~iY bika</foreign>, meaning <foreign lang="ar">kaA^an~iy A^aboSuru bika</foreign> [It is <hi>as though I saw thee</hi>]; i. e. I know from what I witness of thy condition to-day how thy condition will be to-morrow; so that it is as though I saw thee in that condition. (Idem p. 126.) [You also say, <foreign lang="ar">kaA^an~aka bihi</foreign>, meaning Thou art so near to him that it is <hi>as though thou sawest him:</hi> or it is <hi>as though thou wert with him:</hi> i. e. thou art almost in his presence.] ―         -b17-  The Basrees hold that prepositions do not supply the places of other prepositions regularly; but are imagined to do so when they admit of being differently rendered; or it is because a word is sometimes used in the sense of another word, as in <foreign lang="ar">$aribona bimaA='i AlbaHori</foreign> meaning <foreign lang="ar">rawiyna</foreign>, and in <foreign lang="ar">A^aHosana</foreign>

                  </form> is a particle of digression: (Mughnee, K:) or, accord. to Mbr, it denotes emendation, wherever it occurs, in the case of a negation or an affirmation: (T, TA:) or it is a word of emendation, and denoting digression from that which precedes; as also <foreign lang="ar">bano</foreign>, in which the <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign> is a substitute for the <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign>, because <foreign lang="ar">bl</foreign> is of frequent occurrence, and <foreign lang="ar">bn</foreign> is rare; or, as IJ says, the latter may be an independent dial. var. (M.) When it is followed by a proposition, the meaning of the digression is either the cancelling of what precedes, as in <foreign lang="ar">waqaAluwA A@t~axa*a A@lr~aHom`nu waladFA suboHaAnahu balo EibaAdN mukoramuwna</foreign> [<hi>And they said, “ The Compassionate hath gotten offspring: ” extolled be his freedom from that which is derogatory from his glory! nay,</hi> or <hi>nay rather,</hi> or <hi>nay but,</hi> they are <hi>honoured servants</hi> (Kur xxi. 26)], or transition from one object of discourse to another, as in <foreign lang="ar">qado A^afolaHa mano tazak~aY wa *akara A@soma rab~ihi faSal~aY</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">balo tuw^oviruwna A@loHayaApa A@ld~unoyaA</foreign> [<hi>He hath attained felicity who hath purified himself, and celebrated the name of his Lord, and prayed: but ye prefer the present life</hi> (Kur lxxxvii. 14-16)]: (Mughnee, K: *) and in all such cases it is an inceptive particle; not a conjunctive. (Mughnee.) When it is followed by a single word, it is a conjunction, (S, * Msb, * Mughnee, K,) and requires that word to be in the same case as the word before it: (S:) and if preceded by a command or an affirmation, (Mughnee, K,) as in <foreign lang="ar">AiDorabo zayodFA balo EamorFA</foreign> [<hi>Beat thou Zeyd: no, 'Amr</hi>], (Msb, Mughnee, K,) and <foreign lang="ar">qaAma zayodN balo EamorNw</foreign> [<hi>Zeyd stood: no, 'Amr</hi>], (M, Mughnee, K,) or <foreign lang="ar">jaA='aniY A^axuwka balo A^abuwka</foreign> [<hi>Thy brother came to me: no, thy father</hi>], (S,) it makes what precedes it to be as though nothing were said respecting it, (S, * Msb, * Mughnee, K,) making the command or affirmation to relate to what follows it: (S, * Msb, * Mughnee:) [and similar to these cases is the case in which it is preceded by an interrogation: see <foreign lang="ar">A^amo</foreign> as syn. with this particle:] but when it is preceded by a negation or a prohibition, it is used to confirm the meaning of what precedes it and to assign the contrary of that meaning to what follows it, (Mughnee, K,) as in <foreign lang="ar">maA qaAma zayodN EamorNw</foreign> [<hi>Zeyd stood not, but 'Amr stood</hi>], (Mughnee,) or <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">raA^ayotu zayodFA balo EamorFA</foreign>, [<hi>I saw not Zeyd, but I saw 'Amr</hi>], (S,) and <foreign lang="ar">laA yaqumo zayodN balo EamorNw</foreign> [<hi>Let not Zeyd stand, but</hi> let 'Amr stand]. (Mughnee.) Mbr and 'Abd-El-Wárith allow its being used to transfer the meaning of the negation and the prohibition to what follows it; so that, accord. to them, one may say, <foreign lang="ar">maAzayodN qaAy^imFA balo qaAEidFA</foreign> [as meaning <hi>Zeyd is not standing: no,</hi> is not <hi>sitting</hi>], and <foreign lang="ar">balo qaAEidN</foreign> [<hi>but is sitting</hi>]; the meaning being different [in the two cases]. (Mughnee, K. *) The Koofees disallow its being used as a conjunction after anything but a negation [so in the Mughnee, but in the K a prohibition,] or the like thereof; so that one should not say, <foreign lang="ar">Darabotu zayodFA</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">balo A_iy~aAka</foreign> [<hi>I beat Zeyd: no, thee</hi>]. (Mughnee, K.) Sometimes <foreign lang="ar">laA</foreign> is added before it, to corroborate the meaning of digression, after an affirmation, as in the saying, <quote>

It is a reply to an interrogation in which is a negative, (T, M, Msb, Mughnee, K,) and affirms what is said to thee [in that interrogation]; (M, K;) whether it be an interrogation in the proper sense, (Mughnee,) as when you say to another, <foreign lang="ar">A^alamo tafoEalo ka*aA</foreign> [<hi>Didst thou not such a thing?</hi>], and he replies, <foreign lang="ar">balaY</foreign> [meaning <hi>Yes,</hi> or <hi>yea,</hi> or <hi>ay,</hi> I did], (T,) or as when one says, <foreign lang="ar">A^alayosa zayodN biqaAy^imK</foreign> [<hi>Is not Zeyd standing?</hi>], and you reply, <foreign lang="ar">balaY</foreign> [<hi>Yes,</hi> he is]; or be meant to convey reproof, (Mughnee,) as in the Kur [lxxv. 3 and 4], <foreign lang="ar">A^ayaHosabu AlA_inosaAnu A^ano lano najomaEa EiZaAmahu balaY</foreign> [<hi>Doth man think that we will not collect his bones? Yes</hi>], (Msb, Mughnee,) i. e., we will collect them; (Msb;) or be meant to make a person confess, or acknowledge, a thing, (Mughnee,) as in the Kur [vii. 171], <foreign lang="ar">A^alasotu birab~ikumo qaAluwA balaY</foreign> [<hi>Am I not your Lord? They said, Yea</hi>]. (M, Mughnee.) It is also a reply to a simple negation, (Msb, Mughnee,) as when I say, <foreign lang="ar">maA qaAma</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">zayodN</foreign> [<hi>Zeyd did not stand,</hi> or <hi>has not stood</hi>], and you reply, <foreign lang="ar">balaY</foreign> as an affirmative [meaning <hi>Yes,</hi> he did, or he has]. (Msb.) It occurs in the Kur [xxxix. 60], where it is said, <foreign lang="ar">balaY qado jaA='atoka A=yaAtiY</foreign> [<hi>Yea, my signs have come to thee</hi>], preceded by that which is not literally a negation, but which has the force of a negation; for the preceding saying, <foreign lang="ar">lawo A^an~a A@ll~`ha hadaAniY</foreign> [<hi>If God had directed me aright,</hi> or <hi>would that God</hi> &amp;c.], is like the saying, <foreign lang="ar">maA hudiytu</foreign> [<hi>I was not directed aright</hi>]. (M.) It also occurs in the books of traditions, in some instances, as a reply to an interrogation without a negative; but these instances are rare, and not to be followed in rendering revelation. (Mughnee.) Az says that when a man says to another, <foreign lang="ar">A^alaA taquwmu</foreign> [<hi>Wilt thou not stand?</hi>], and the latter replies, <foreign lang="ar">balaY</foreign>, he means <foreign lang="ar">balo A^aquwmu</foreign> [<hi>Nay, I will stand</hi>], adding the alif [written <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign>] to make the pause good; for if he said, <foreign lang="ar">balo</foreign>, the other would expect something more to be said after it. (TA.) It is said that the pronunciation termed imáleh is allowable in the case of <foreign lang="ar">balaY</foreign>; and if so, its final radical letter is <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign>: and some of the grammarians say that this pronunciation of <foreign lang="ar">blY</foreign> is because, by reason of its completeness and independence of meaning, so that it requires nothing after it, it resembles independent nouns, in the cases of which this pronunciation is allowable.
