                  <hi>The twentieth letter of the alphabet:</hi> called <foreign lang="ar">faA='N</foreign> [and <foreign lang="ar">faA</foreign>]. (TA.) It is one of the letters termed <foreign lang="ar">mahomuwsap</foreign> [or non-vocal, i. e. pronounced with the breath only, without the voice], and of those termed <foreign lang="ar">$afawiy~ap</foreign> [or labial]: (TA:) it is a radical letter, and not augmentative: (TA in <foreign lang="ar">bAb AlAlf</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">Ally~np</foreign>:) sometimes it is substituted for <foreign lang="ar">v</foreign>; thus in the conjunction <foreign lang="ar">vum~a</foreign>, as in the saying <foreign lang="ar">jaA='a zayodN fum~a</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">EamorNw</foreign> [“ Zeyd came, then 'Amr ”]; and in <foreign lang="ar">Alv~uwmu</foreign>, “ the well-known herb so called [?], ” for which they say <foreign lang="ar">Alfuwmu</foreign>; and in <foreign lang="ar">Aljadavu</foreign>, “ the grave, ” or “ sepulchre, ” for which they say <foreign lang="ar">Aljadafu</foreign>, but using for the pl. <foreign lang="ar">A^ajodaAvN</foreign>, and not <foreign lang="ar">A^ajodaAfN</foreign>, accord. to IJ, (MF, TA,) [unless, app., by poetic license, for] the latter pl. is used by Ru-beh. (R and TA in art. <foreign lang="ar">jdf</foreign>.)       -A2-  <foreign lang="ar">fa</foreign> is a particle having no government: (Mughnee, * K, * TA:) or it governs a mansoob aor.; as in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign>

                  </quote> [<hi>Many a one like thee,</hi> even such as was <hi>pregnant, have I visited by night, and</hi> such as was <hi>suckling</hi>]; but the truth is, that what here governs the gen. case is <foreign lang="ar">rub~a</foreign>, meant to be understood; (Mughnee, TA;) like as it often is in the case of <foreign lang="ar">wa</foreign>, as is said in the Lubáb. (TA.) ―         -b2-  It occurs used in three manners; in one whereof it is an adjunctive to an antecedent, and denotes three things: ―         -b3-  one of these is order; and this is of two sorts; relating to the meaning, as in <foreign lang="ar">qaAma zayodN faEamorNw</foreign> [<hi>Zeyd came, and after him 'Amr</hi>]; and relating to a verbal statement, which is an adjoining of an explicit clause to an implicit antecedent, as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 34] <foreign lang="ar">faA^azal~ahumaA A@l$~ayoTaAnu EanohaA faA^axorajahumaA mim~aA kaAnaA fiyhi</foreign> [<hi>And the Devil caused them both to slip,</hi> or <hi>fall, from it</hi> (i. e. from Paradise), <hi>and ejected them from that</hi> state of enjoyment <hi>in which they were</hi>]: (Mughnee, K: *) ―         -b4-  the second thing that it denotes when used as an adjunctive to an antecedent is proximate sequence, and this is in everything [i. e. in every case] according to the estimate thereof; (Mughnee, K; *) [meaning, according to the relative, or comparative, estimate of the time implied; for, as is said in an explanation of the words thus rendered, in a marginal note in my copy of the Mughnee, “ the long period is sometimes esteemed short by comparison; ” or it may be defined as a particle denoting sequence in a case in which is an uninterrupted connection between two events;] one says <foreign lang="ar">tazaw~aja fulaAnN fawulida lahu</foreign> [<hi>Such a one took a wife, and, in uninterrupted connection with his doing so, a child was born to him,</hi>] when there did not intervene between the two events aught save the period of gestation, (Mughnee, K, *) and so if it were a period protracted [beyond the usual length]; and you say <foreign lang="ar">daxalotu AlbaSorapa fabagodaAda</foreign> [<hi>I entered El-Basrah, and, in uninterrupted connection with my doing so, Baghdád,</hi>] when you did not stay in El-Basrah nor between the two towns: and this sequence is not necessarily implied by the <foreign lang="ar">f</foreign> that denotes causality; as is shown by the correctness of one's saying <foreign lang="ar">A_ino</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">yusolimo fahuwa yadoxulu Aljan~apa</foreign> [<hi>If he become a Muslim, he will consequently enter Paradise</hi>]; the delay between the two events [by death &amp;c.] being well known: (Mughnee:) ―         -b5-  [or, accord. to J,] the adjunctive <foreign lang="ar">f</foreign> occurs in three cases, in the first of which it denotes order and proximate sequence with association; you say, <foreign lang="ar">Darabotu zayodFA faEamorFA</foreign> [<hi>I beat Zeyd, and next 'Amr</hi>]: (S: [the second and third of these cases will be mentioned in the course of this art:]) ―         -b6-  and it is said to occur sometimes in the sense of <foreign lang="ar">vum~a</foreign>, (Mughnee, K, * TA, *) denoting conjunction in an absolute manner, with delay; (TA;) as in the saying [in the Kur xxiii. 14] <foreign lang="ar">vum~a xalaqonaA A@ln~uTofapa EalaqapF faxalaqonaA A@loEalaqapa muDogapF</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">faxalaqonaA A@lomuDogapa EiZaAmFA fakasawonaA A@loEiZaAma laHomFA</foreign> [<hi>Then we made the sperm a lump of clotted blood, then we made the lump of clotted blood a bit of flesh, then we made the bit of flesh bones, then we clothed the bones with flesh</hi>]: (Mughnee, K, TA:) ―         -b7-  and sometimes in the sense of <foreign lang="ar">wa</foreign>, (Mughnee, K, * TA, *) denoting conjunction in an absolute manner, without order; (TA;) as in the saying (of Imra-el-Keys, TA), <foreign lang="ar">bayona Ald~axuwli</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">faHawomali</foreign> [as though meaning <hi>Between Ed-Dakhool and Howmal</hi>]; (Mughnee, K, TA;) the right reading of which is asserted by As to be with <foreign lang="ar">wa</foreign>; but it is replied that the implied meaning is <foreign lang="ar">bayona mawaADiEi Ald~axuwli famawaADiEi Hawomali</foreign> [<hi>amidst the places of,</hi> or <hi>pertaining to, Ed-Dakhool, and the places of,</hi> or <hi>pertaining to, Howmal;</hi> the former places and the latter being contiguous; and we may therefore understand these words as relating to an antecedent command to pause]; this phrase being allowable like the saying <foreign lang="ar">jalasotu bayona AlEulamaA='i faAlz~uh~aAdi</foreign> [<hi>I sat amidst the learned men and the devotees</hi>]: it has been said that <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign> is here suppressed before <foreign lang="ar">bayona</foreign>, and that <foreign lang="ar">fa</foreign> is used in the place of <foreign lang="ar">A_ilaY</foreign>; but this usage of <foreign lang="ar">fa</foreign> is strange: (Mughnee:) ―         -b8-  the third thing that it denotes when used as an adjunctive to an antecedent is relation to a cause: (Mughnee, K, * TA: *) this is the second of the three cases mentioned by J, who says, (TA,) it is when what precedes it is a cause of what follows it; and it denotes adjunction and proximate sequence without association; as in the sayings <foreign lang="ar">Darabahu fabakaY</foreign> [<hi>He beat him, and he consequently wept,</hi>] and <foreign lang="ar">Darabahu faA^awojaEahu</foreign> [<hi>He beat him, and consequently pained him,</hi>] when the beating is the cause of the weeping and of the pain: (S, TA:) used in this manner, i. e. to denote relation to a cause, it is generally such as adjoins a proposition, as in [the saying in the Kur xxviii. 14] <foreign lang="ar">fawakazahu muwsaY faqaDaY Ealayohi</foreign> [<hi>And Moses struck him with his fist, and consequently killed him</hi>]; or a qualificative, as in [the saying in the Kur lvi. 52-54] <foreign lang="ar">laA=kiluwna mino $ajarK mino zaq~uwmK famaAliy^uwna minohaA</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">A@lobuTuwna fa$aAribuwna Ealayohi mina A@loHamiymi</foreign> [<hi>Shall surely be eating from trees of Zakkoom, and consequently filling therefrom the bellies, and drinking thereon of hot water</hi>]. (Mughnee, K.) ―         -b9-  Another manner in which it is used [the second of the three manners before mentioned (Mughnee)] is as a connective of an apodosis, i. e., of the complement of a conditional clause, (Mughnee, * K, * TA,) when this is of a kind not fit to be itself conditional, i. e., to be a protasis. (Mughnee.) It is thus used when the complement is a <pb n="2322"/> nominal proposition; as in [the saying in the Kur vi. 17] <foreign lang="ar">waA_ino yamosasoka bixayorK fahuwa EalaY kul~i $aYo'K</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">qadiyrN</foreign> [<hi>And if He cause good to betide thee, He is able to do everything</hi>]: (Mughnee, K, TA:) this is the third of the three cases mentioned by J, who says, (TA,) this is when it is used for the purpose of inception, in the complement of a conditional clause; as in the saying <foreign lang="ar">A_ino tazuroniY</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">faA^anota muHosinN</foreign> [<hi>If thou visit me, thou wilt be a welldoer</hi>]; in which what follows <foreign lang="ar">fa</foreign> is a new proposition, grammatically independent of what precedes it, one part thereof governing another; for <foreign lang="ar">A^anota</foreign> is an inchoative, and <foreign lang="ar">muHosinN</foreign> is its enunciative; and the proposition has become a complement by means of the <foreign lang="ar">f</foreign>: (S, TA:) ―         -b10-  or, (K,) secondly, (Mughnee,) the complement may be a verbal proposition, like the nominal, and it is one of which the verb is aplastic; as in [the saying in the Kur xviii. 37 and 38] <foreign lang="ar">A_ino tarani A^anaA</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">A^aqal~a minoka maAlFA wawaladFA faEasaY rab~iY A^ano yuw^otiyani</foreign> [<hi>If thou seest me to be possessing less than thou in respect of wealth and children, it may be that my Lord may give me</hi>]; and [the saying in the Kur ii. 273] <foreign lang="ar">A_ino tuboduwA A@lS~adaqaAti faniEim~aA hiYa</foreign> [<hi>If ye make apparent the alms, very good, as a thing, is it,</hi> i. e. the doing so]: (Mughnee, K:) ―         -b11-  or, (K,) thirdly, (Mughnee,) the verb of the complement may be one belonging to a new proposition, grammatically independent of what precedes it, as in [the saying in the Kur iii. 29] <foreign lang="ar">A_ino kunotumo</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">tuHib~uwna A@ll~`ha faA@t~abiEuwniY</foreign> [<hi>If ye love God, follow ye me</hi>]: (Mughnee, K:) ―         -b12-  or, (K,) fourthly, (Mughnee,) the verb of the complement may be a pret., as to the letter and as to the meaning; either properly, as in [the saying in the Kur xii. 77] <foreign lang="ar">A_ino yasoriqo faqado saraqa A^axN lahu mino qabolu</foreign> [<hi>If he steal, a brother of his hath stolen before</hi>]: or tropically, as in [the saying in the Kur xxvii. 92] <foreign lang="ar">wamano jaA='a biA@ls~ay~iy^api fakub~ato wujuwhumumo fiY Aln~aAri</foreign> [<hi>And whoever shall have done that which is evil, their faces are inverted in the fire</hi> of Hell], this [latter] verb being used as though signifying what has already happened to denote the certain assurance of the event's happening: (Mughnee, K: *) ―         -b13-  fifthly, when the <foreign lang="ar">f</foreign> is coupled with a particle relating to futurity; as in [the saying in the Kur v. 59] <foreign lang="ar">mano yarotad~a minokumo Eano diynihi fasawofa yaA^otiY A@ll~`hu</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">biqawomK yuHib~uhumo</foreign> [<hi>Whoever of you revolteth from his religion, God will bring a people whom He loveth</hi>]; and in [the saying in the Kur iii. 111] <foreign lang="ar">wFmaA tafoEaluwA mino xayorK falano tukofaruwhu</foreign> [<hi>And what ye do of good, ye shall not be denied</hi> the reward of <hi>it</hi>]: (Mughnee: omitted in the K; as is also what here next follows:) ―         -b14-  sixthly, when the <foreign lang="ar">f</foreign> is coupled with a particle to which is peculiarly assigned the first place in a proposition, as in the saying, <quote>

                  <foreign lang="ar">xiloqapN</foreign>. (S, Mgh.) It is said to have this signification in the Kur xxx. 29. (TA.) And so in the saying of Mohammad, <foreign lang="ar">kul~u mawoluwdK yuwladu EalaY</foreign>

                  <hi>Every infant is born in a state of conformity to the natural constitution with which he is created in his mother's womb,</hi> either <hi>prosperous</hi> or <hi>unprosperous</hi> [<hi>in relation to the soul</hi>]; and if his parents are Jews, they make him a Jew, with respect to his worldly predicament; [i. e., with respect to inheritances &amp;c.;] and if Christians, they make him a Christian, with respect to that predicament; and if Magians, they make him a Magian, with respect to that predicament; his predicament is the same as that of his parents until his tongue speaks for him: but if he die before his attaining to the age when virility begins to show itself, he dies in a state of conformity to his preceding natural constitution, with which he was created in his mother's womb. (AHeyth, TA.) [See another explanation of the word, as occurring in this trad., below.] ―         -b3-  <hi>Nature; constitution;</hi> or <hi>natural, native, innate,</hi> or <hi>original, disposition,</hi> or <hi>temper</hi> or other <hi>quality</hi> or <hi>property; idiosyncrasy.</hi> (Th, TA.) ―         -b4-  The <hi>faculty of knowing God, with which He has created mankind:</hi> (TA:) the <hi>natural constitution with which a child is created in his mother's womb, whereby he is capable of accepting the religion of truth:</hi> this is a secondary application: and this is [said to be] the signification meant in the trad. mentioned above.

This is shown by a trad., in which it is related that Mohammad taught a man to repeat certain words when lying down to sleep, and said <foreign lang="ar">faA_in~aka A_ino mut~a mino layolatika</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">mut~a EalaY AlfiTorapi</foreign> [<hi>And then, if thou die that same night, thou diest in the profession of the true religion</hi>]. (AHeyth, TA.) Also by the saying, <foreign lang="ar">qaS~u</foreign>

[Or in these and similar instances, <foreign lang="ar">fiY</foreign> may be rendered, more agreeably with the primary signification, as meaning <hi>Among.</hi>] In the K, the meaning as denoting concomitance and that which is identical with <foreign lang="ar">maEa</foreign> are made distinct: and it has been said that <foreign lang="ar">bi</foreign> denotes the continuance of concomitance and <foreign lang="ar">maEa</foreign> denotes its commencement; though this is not invariably the case. (MF, TA.) [Hence it is used to denote a combination of two qualities: as in the phrase <foreign lang="ar">TuwlN fiY A@sotiroxaA='K</foreign> (assumed tropical:)  <hi>Length together with laxness:</hi> (occurring in the K voce <foreign lang="ar">TanabN</foreign>:) and <foreign lang="ar">sawaAdN fiY HumorapK</foreign> (assumed tropical:)  <hi>Blackness</hi> blending <hi>with redness:</hi> and the like. And in like manner it is used to denote the combination of the length and breadth of a thing: as in the phrase <foreign lang="ar">Tuwluhu Ei$oruwna *iraAEFA fiY valaAvi A^a*oruEK EaroDFA</foreign> 
                  <hi>Its length is twenty cubits with</hi> (or as we say <hi>by</hi>) <hi>three cubits in breadth:</hi> in which case the number of square cubits is expressed by the phrase <foreign lang="ar">Ei$oruwna fiY valaAvK</foreign> as though meaning <hi>Twenty</hi> as a multiplicand <hi>with three</hi> as its multiplier; i. e. <hi>twenty multiplied by three:</hi> see <foreign lang="ar">Daraba</foreign> as signifying “ he multiplied. ”]. ―         -b4-  It also denotes the assigning of a cause. (Msb, Mughnee, K.) Thus in the phrase <foreign lang="ar">fiY A^arobaEiyna $aApN</foreign> i. e. <hi>On account,</hi> or <hi>because, of</hi> completing [the possession of] <hi>forty sheep</hi> or <hi>goats,</hi> [the giving of] <pb n="2467"/> 
                  <hi>a sheep</hi> or <hi>goat</hi> [for the poor-rate] is incumbent [on the possessor: or this may be rendered, <hi>in the case of</hi> the possession <hi>of forty, a sheep</hi> or <hi>goat</hi> is to be given]. (Msb.) And thus in the saying, [in the Kur xii. 32,] <foreign lang="ar">fa*`likun~a A@l~a*iY lumotun~aniY</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">fiyhi</foreign> [<hi>And that is he because of whom ye blamed me</hi>]. (Mughnee.)

(Mughnee.) [And thus in the phrase <foreign lang="ar">A^asolafa fiY ka*aA</foreign> 
                  <hi>He paid in advance,</hi> or <hi>beforehand, for,</hi> or <hi>on account of, such a thing.</hi>] ―         -b5-  It also denotes superiority; (Mughnee, K, TA;) i. e. (TA) it is used in the sense of <foreign lang="ar">EalaY</foreign>. (T, S, M, Msb, TA.) Thus in the saying, in the Kur [xx. 74], <foreign lang="ar">walaA^uSal~iban~akumo fiY</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">ju*uwEi A@ln~axoli</foreign> [<hi>And I will assuredly crucify you upon the trunks of palm-trees</hi>]. (T, S, Msb, Mughnee, TA.) And so in the verse of 'Antarah cited voce <foreign lang="ar">saroHN</foreign>. (T, M, Mughnee, TA.) And Yoo asserts that the Arabs say, <foreign lang="ar">nazalotu fiY A^abiyka</foreign>, meaning <foreign lang="ar">Ealayohi</foreign> [i. e. <hi>I alighted,</hi> or <hi>descended and stopped,</hi> &amp;c., <hi>at the abode of thy father</hi>].
