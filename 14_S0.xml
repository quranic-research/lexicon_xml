								<hi>The fourteenth letter of the alphabet;</hi> called <foreign lang="ar">SaAdN</foreign>. It is one of the letters termed <foreign lang="ar">mahomuwsap</foreign> [or nonvocal, i. e. pronounced with the breath only, without the voice]; and of the letters termed <foreign lang="ar">A^asaliy~ap</foreign>, as also <foreign lang="ar">z</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">s</foreign>, because proceeding from the tip of the tongue; (TA;) and is one of the letters termed <foreign lang="ar">musotaEoliyap</foreign>, which are obstacles to <foreign lang="ar">A_imaAlap</foreign>: (M in art. <foreign lang="ar">Swd</foreign>:) it is not conjoined with <foreign lang="ar">s</foreign>, nor with <foreign lang="ar">z</foreign>, [nor, as some say, with <foreign lang="ar">j</foreign>, (see <foreign lang="ar">A_ij~aASN</foreign>,)] in any Arabic word. (TA. [See also art. <foreign lang="ar">Swd</foreign>.]) It is a radical, and a substitute; not an augmentative. (M in art. <foreign lang="ar">Swd</foreign>.) It is sometimes substituted for <foreign lang="ar">s</foreign>; and, as MF observes, what Ibn-Umm-Kásim says appears to mean that this substitution is allowable unrestrictedly; but Ibn-Málik, in the Tes-heel, makes it subject to conditions, saying that it is allowable accord. to a certain dial. when the <foreign lang="ar">s</foreign> is followed by <foreign lang="ar">g</foreign> or <foreign lang="ar">x</foreign> or <foreign lang="ar">q</foreign> or <foreign lang="ar">T</foreign>, even when separated therefrom by a letter or by two letters: MF says that the dial. above mentioned is that of Benu-l-'Ambar, accord. to Sb and others; who give as exs. <foreign lang="ar">Sagiba</foreign> for <foreign lang="ar">sagiba</foreign>, and <foreign lang="ar">Saxira</foreign> for <foreign lang="ar">saxira</foreign>, and <foreign lang="ar">SaqabN</foreign> for <foreign lang="ar">saqabN</foreign>, and <foreign lang="ar">SaTaEa</foreign> for <foreign lang="ar">saTaEa</foreign>.

								The <hi>root</hi> of a word, <hi>from which proceed the derivatives of verbs:</hi> (Lth, TA:) [in this sense it is a conventional term of grammar and lexicology, not belonging to the classical language; but on account of the importance of understanding its true application in lexicology, it is necessary to give here a full explanation of it: it is, agreeably with its etymology, the <hi>source</hi> (lit. place) <hi>of derivation,</hi> accord. to the grammarians of ElBasrah; and is what I term <hi>an infinitive noun:</hi> it is defined as] <hi>a noun signifying, by its original application, an accident as subsisting in,</hi> or <hi>proceeding from, an agent</hi> (as <foreign lang="ar">AlfaraHu</foreign> [“ the being joyful ”], <foreign lang="ar">AlD~arobu</foreign> [“ the act of beating ”], and <foreign lang="ar">AlquEuwdu</foreign> [“ the act of sitting ”]), or <hi>affecting an object of action,</hi> (as <foreign lang="ar">Aljunuwnu</foreign> [“ the being possessed by a jinnee ”]), <hi>conformable to its verb, so as to comprise all the letters in that verb, either literally</hi> (as in the instances above) <hi>or virtually</hi> (as in <foreign lang="ar">AlqitaAlu</foreign> [“ the act of fighting ”], which wants the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> that is before the <foreign lang="ar">t</foreign> in the verb, yet wants it as to the letter only, and not virtually, wherefore it is sometimes pronounced as if with the said letter, as in <foreign lang="ar">qaAtala qiytaAlFA</foreign>, but the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> is changed into <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign> on account of the kesr of the letter before it), or <hi>substituting another letter for any of those letters that it wants</hi> (as in <foreign lang="ar">AlEidapu</foreign> [“ the act of promising ”], which wants the <foreign lang="ar">w</foreign> that is in its verb as to the letter and virtually, but has <foreign lang="ar">p</foreign> substituted for it [by way of compensation]): (from a comparison of definitions &amp;c. in the Expos. of the “ Kitab Hodood en-Nahw ” by the author of the work thus entitled, arts. <foreign lang="ar">mSdr</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">Asm mSdr</foreign>; the Expos. of the “ Shudhoor edh-Dhahab ” by the author of the work thus entitled, section on the nouns that govern as verbs; I' Ak; &amp;c.:) but the grammarians of El-Koofeh hold that the verb is the root, and that the <foreign lang="ar">mSdr</foreign> is derived from it: (I' Ak p. 148:) some <foreign lang="ar">mSAdr</foreign>, moreover, are derived from real (as opposed to ideal) substantives, as <foreign lang="ar">Alt~aHaj~uru</foreign> [“ the becoming stone ”] from <foreign lang="ar">AlHajaru</foreign> [“ stone ”]. (Kull p. 327.) The <foreign lang="ar">mSdr</foreign> has the same government as its own verb: it is often, and may be at pleasure, used as an ideal subst. or abstract noun: and it is often employed in the place of an act. or a pass. part. n.: (Kull, &amp;c.:) [when thus used as an epithet, it is employed alike as sing. and pl. and masc. and fem.:] accord. to Zj, every <foreign lang="ar">mSdr</foreign> used as an epithet is for <foreign lang="ar">*uw</foreign> [or <foreign lang="ar">*aAt</foreign> &amp;c.] followed by the <foreign lang="ar">mSdr</foreign>, and therefore it has no dual nor pl.

								<foreign lang="ar">Aisomu maSodarK</foreign>, called by some <foreign lang="ar">AisomN lilomaSodari</foreign>, is a term applied to [(assumed tropical:)

								<foreign lang="ar">mSdr</foreign>, <hi>but which is occasionally used in the place of a</hi>

(Expos. of the “ Kitáb el- Hodood, ” cited above.) This kind of noun the grammarians of El-Koofeh and Baghdád allow to govern as a <foreign lang="ar">mSdr</foreign>; but the grammarians of ElBasrah hold that the noun governed in the accus. case in each of the exs. adduced by the former as confirmatory of their opinion is so governed by a verb understood. (Expos. of the “ Shudhoor, ” ubi suprà.) It is also applied to <hi>A proper name signifying an accident</hi> [or <hi>attribute</hi>]; as <foreign lang="ar">fajaAri</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">HamaAdi</foreign>, proper names, by original application, for <foreign lang="ar">Alfajorapu</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">AlmaHomadapu</foreign> [“ vice ” and “ praise ”] and the like: and this kind does not govern as a <foreign lang="ar">mSdr</foreign>. (Expos. of the “ Kitáb Hodood enNahw, ” ubi suprà; and Expos. of the “ Shudhoor, ” ubi suprà.) It is also applied to [what is more properly termed <foreign lang="ar">AisomN lilomaEonaY AlHaASili biAlmaSodari</foreign>, by some termed simply <foreign lang="ar">HaASilN biAlmaSodari</foreign>, i. e. <hi>An ideal substantive,</hi> or <hi>abstract noun;</hi>] <hi>a noun applied to signify an accident</hi> [or <hi>attribute</hi>] <hi>considered abstractedly</hi> [such as <foreign lang="ar">SadarN</foreign> signifying “ return; ” and this kind is commonly termed in the lexicons simply an <foreign lang="ar">Aisom</foreign> as distinguished from a <foreign lang="ar">mSdr</foreign>]. (Kull p. 327.) Some apply it also to what is [properly] termed <foreign lang="ar">maSodarN miymiY~N</foreign> [i. e. <hi>A</hi> 
								<foreign lang="ar">mSdr</foreign> 
								<hi>commencing with an augmentative</hi>

(Expos. of the “ Shudhoor, ” ubi suprà.) And some of the grammarians [and of the lexicographers likewise] apply it to <hi>A noun that signifies the instrument</hi> [or <hi>means</hi>] <hi>with</hi> [or <hi>by</hi>] <hi>which the action signified by a</hi> 
								<foreign lang="ar">mSdr</foreign> 
								<hi>is performed:</hi> as <foreign lang="ar">AlA^ukolu</foreign> [“ food, ” as being “ that by means of which the act of eating (<foreign lang="ar">AlA^akolu</foreign>) is performed ”]. (Kull, ubi suprà.)
