								<hi>This is forbidden,</hi> or <hi>unlawful, to thee.</hi> (A.) In the time of paganism, a man meeting another whom he feared, in a sacred month, used to say, 
							<anchor type="arrow"><foreign lang="ar">HijorFA maHojuwrFA↓</foreign></anchor>, meaning <hi>It is rigorously forbidden</hi> to thee [to commit an act of hostility against me] in this month: and the latter, thereupon, would abstain from any aggression against him: and so, on the day of resurrection, the polytheists, when they see the punishment, will say to the angels, thinking that it will profit them: (Lth, S: *) but Az says that I' Ab and his companions explain these words [occurring in the Kur xxv. 24] otherwise, i. e., as said by the angels, and meaning, the joyful annunciation is forbidden to be made to you: and accord. to El-Hasan, the former word will be said by the sinners, and the latter is said by God, meaning it will be forbidden to them to be granted refuge or protection as they used to be in their former life in the world: but Az adds, it is more proper to regard the two words as composing one saying: (TA:) and the latter word is a corroborative of the former, like <foreign lang="ar">maAy^itN</foreign> in the expression <foreign lang="ar">mawotN maAy^itN</foreign>. (Bd.) The same words in the Kur xxv. 55 signify <hi>A strong mutual repugnance,</hi> or <hi>incongruity;</hi> as though each said what one says who seeks refuge or protection from another: or, as some say, <hi>a defined limit.</hi> (Bd.) A man says to another, “ Dost thou so and so, O such a one?” and the latter replies <foreign lang="ar">HijorFA</foreign>, or 
							<anchor type="arrow"><foreign lang="ar">HujorFA↓</foreign></anchor>, or 
							<anchor type="arrow"><foreign lang="ar">HajorFA↓</foreign></anchor>, meaning [I pray for] <hi>preservation, and acquitment,</hi> from this thing; a meaning reducible to that of prohibition, and of a thing that is prohibited.

								<foreign lang="ar">Hasobu</foreign> is a [prefixed] noun (S) [syn. with <foreign lang="ar">kafoYu</foreign>, as is implied in the K voce <foreign lang="ar">qaTo</foreign>; or] syn. with <foreign lang="ar">kaAfiY</foreign>; (Msb;) or [virtually] meaning <foreign lang="ar">kafaY</foreign> [as a pret. in the sense of an emphatic aor.]; (S, K;) or <foreign lang="ar">yakofiY</foreign>: (TA:) Sb says that it is used to denote the being sufficed, or content. (TA.) You say, <foreign lang="ar">Hasobuka dirohamN</foreign> [and <foreign lang="ar">biHasobika dirohamN</foreign>, in which latter the <foreign lang="ar">b</foreign> is redundant; meaning <hi>Thy sufficiency,</hi> or <hi>a thing sufficing thee, is a dirhem;</hi> a phrase which may be used in two ways; as predicating of what is sufficient, that it is a dirhem; and as predicating of a dirhem, that it is sufficient; in which latter case, <foreign lang="ar">bHsbk</foreign> is an enunciative put before its inchoative, (as also <foreign lang="ar">Hasobuka</foreign>,) so that the meaning is, <hi>a dirhem is a thing sufficing thee,</hi> i. e. <hi>a dirhem is sufficient for thee;</hi> as is shown in a marginal note in my copy of the Mughnee, in art. <foreign lang="ar">bi</foreign>; or, accord. to the S and K, <hi>a dirhem suffices thee:</hi> accord. to Bd (iii. 167), <foreign lang="ar">bHsbk</foreign> means <foreign lang="ar">muHosibuka</foreign>, and <foreign lang="ar">kaAfiyka</foreign>, from <foreign lang="ar">A^aHosabahu</foreign> meaning <foreign lang="ar">kafaAhu</foreign>; and is shown to have this meaning by its not importing a determinate signification in consequence of its being a prefixed noun with its complement in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">h`*aA rajulN Hasobuka</foreign> 
								<hi>This is a man sufficing thee</hi>]. (S, Msb, K.) You say also, <foreign lang="ar">Hasobuka *`lika</foreign>

								<hi>This is a man sufficing thee as a man,</hi> i. e. <hi>supplying to thee the place of any other</hi> [by his excellent qualities], (S, K,) and <foreign lang="ar">mararotu birajulK Hasobika mino rajulK</foreign> 
								<hi>I passed by a man sufficing thee as a man,</hi> (TA,) <foreign lang="ar">Hsbk</foreign> is an expression of praise, referring to the indeterminate noun [<foreign lang="ar">rjl</foreign>]; because, in its case, [what is originally (see below)] an inf. n. (<foreign lang="ar">fiEolN</foreign> [under which term lexicologists, but not grammarians, include the <foreign lang="ar">maSodar</foreign>]) is rendered, in grammatical analysis, by another word, [i. e., by an act. part. n.,] as though one said <foreign lang="ar">muHosibN laka</foreign>, or <foreign lang="ar">kaAfK</foreign> 
								<foreign lang="ar">laka</foreign>. (S. [Thus <foreign lang="ar">Hsbk</foreign> in these two instances is a <foreign lang="ar">Sifap</foreign>, i. e. an epithetic phrase; and <foreign lang="ar">mn rjl</foreign> is a <foreign lang="ar">tamoyiyz</foreign>, i. e. a specificative phrase.]) When the noun to which <foreign lang="ar">Hsbk</foreign> refers is determinate, you put <foreign lang="ar">Hsb</foreign> in the accus. case, as a <foreign lang="ar">HAl</foreign>, i. e. a denotative of state; as in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">h`*aA Eabodu</foreign> 
								<foreign lang="ar">A@ll~`hi Hasobaka mino rajulK</foreign> 
								<hi>This is 'Abd-Allah; being one sufficing thee as a man.</hi> (S. [Here <foreign lang="ar">mn rjl</foreign> is, as before, a specificative phrase.]) [See also 4, the corresponding verb.]) <foreign lang="ar">Hsb</foreign>, in this manner, is used alike as sing. and dual and pl.; (S, K;) being [originally] an inf. n. (S.) It is also used alone, [as a prefixed noun of which the complement is understood,] as in the phrase <foreign lang="ar">zayodN Hasobu</foreign>, without tenween, for <foreign lang="ar">HasobiY</foreign> or <foreign lang="ar">Hasobuka</foreign> [&amp;c., meaning <hi>Zeyd is sufficient for me</hi> or <hi>for thee</hi> &amp;c.]; like as one says, <foreign lang="ar">jaA='aniY zayodN layosa gayoru</foreign>, for <foreign lang="ar">layosa gayoruhu EinodiY</foreign>. (S. [That is, <foreign lang="ar">Hasobu</foreign>, when thus used, is subject to the same rules as <foreign lang="ar">gayoru</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">qabolu</foreign>, and <foreign lang="ar">baEodu</foreign> &amp;c. when so used.])
