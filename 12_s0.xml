								<hi>The twelfth letter of the alphabet;</hi> called <foreign lang="ar">siynN</foreign>. It is one of the letters termed <foreign lang="ar">mahomuwsap</foreign> [or non-vocal, i. e. pronounced with the breath only, without the voice]; and of the letters termed <foreign lang="ar">OasaliyRap</foreign>, as also <foreign lang="ar">S</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">z</foreign>, because proceeding from the tip of the tongue: its place of utterance is between that of <foreign lang="ar">S</foreign> and that of <foreign lang="ar">z</foreign>: and Az says hat it is never conjoined with either of these two letters in any Arabic word: (TA:) it is a sibilant letter; and is distinguished from <foreign lang="ar">S</foreign> by the raising of the tongue to the palate [in the utterance of the latter], and from <foreign lang="ar">z</foreign> by the suppression of the voice [in the utterance of the former]. (K in art. <foreign lang="ar">syn</foreign>.) It is one of the letters of augmentation [occurring in the form <foreign lang="ar">AisotafoEala</foreign> and its derivatives]. (S and L in art. <foreign lang="ar">syn</foreign>.) [See also <foreign lang="ar">siynN</foreign> in art. <foreign lang="ar">syn</foreign>. It is sometimes substituted for <foreign lang="ar">S</foreign>; as in <foreign lang="ar">saqorN</foreign>, for <foreign lang="ar">SaqorN</foreign>: and for <foreign lang="ar">X</foreign>, as in <foreign lang="ar">siToranojN</foreign>, for <foreign lang="ar">XiToranojN</foreign>: (see De Sacy's Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed., ii. 230-233: and iii. 530-532:)] and AZ says that some of the Arabs substitute for it <foreign lang="ar">t</foreign>, (S and L and K * in art. <foreign lang="ar">syn</foreign>,) as in the saying (S and L in art. <foreign lang="ar">syn</foreign>) of 'Alyà Ibn-Arkam, (L ib.,)

								[<hi>O, may God remove far from good,</hi> or <hi>from prosperity, the sons of the Sialáh, 'Amr Ibn-Yarbooa, the worst of mankind: they are not chaste, nor sharp in intellect</hi>]: he means <foreign lang="ar">AlnRaAsi</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">biOakoyaAsi</foreign>: (S and L ib.:) and in like manner one says <foreign lang="ar">TasotN</foreign> for <foreign lang="ar">TasRN</foreign>.

								<foreign lang="ar">yesL</foreign> in the Kur [commencing ch. xxxvi.] is like <foreign lang="ar">MlLmL</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">HemL</foreign> at the commencement of chapters of the same; and is said by 'Ikrimeh to mean <foreign lang="ar">yaA UinosaAnu</foreign> [<hi>O man</hi>]; because it is followed by the words <foreign lang="ar">UinRaka lamina Almurosaliyna</foreign>: (S and L in art. <foreign lang="ar">syn</foreign>:) or it means either thus, or <foreign lang="ar">yaA sayRidu</foreign> [<hi>O man of dignity</hi>]. (K in art. <foreign lang="ar">syn</foreign>.)

								<foreign lang="ar">sa</foreign> is a particle peculiarly prefixed to the aor., rendering it clearly denotative of the future, (Mughnee, and S * and L * in art. <foreign lang="ar">syn</foreign>,) as in <foreign lang="ar">sayafoEalu</foreign> [<hi>He will do</hi> such a thing], (S and L ib.,) and considered as forming a part thereof, for which reason it does not exercise any government upon it: it is not contracted from <foreign lang="ar">sawofa</foreign>, contrary to what the Koofees hold: nor is the extent of the future with it shorter than it is with <foreign lang="ar">sawofa</foreign>, contrary to what the Basrees hold: the analytical grammarians term it <foreign lang="ar">Harofu tanofiysK</foreign>, by which is meant a particle of amplification; because it changes the aor. from the strait time, which is the present, to the ample time, which is the future: but plainer that their expression is the saying of Z and others, [that it is] a particle denoting the future. (Mughnee.) Kh asserts that it corresponds [as an affirmative] to [the negative] <foreign lang="ar">lano</foreign>. (S and L in art. <foreign lang="ar">syn</foreign>.) Some assert that it sometimes denotes continuance, not futurity: this is mentioned in relation to the saying in the Kur [iv. 93], <foreign lang="ar">satajiduwna Mxariyna</foreign> [as though meaning <hi>Ye continually find others</hi>]; and they adduce as an evidence thereof the saying in the same [ii. 136], <foreign lang="ar">sayaquwlu QlsRafahaMCu mina QlnRaAsi maA</foreign> 
								<foreign lang="ar">walRaAhumo Eano qibolatihimo</foreign> [as meaning <hi>The light-witted of the people continually say, What hath turned them away,</hi> or <hi>back, from their kibleh?</hi>]; affirming that this was revealed after their saying <foreign lang="ar">maA walRaAhumo</foreign>: but this the grammarians know not; and that this verse was revealed after their saying <foreign lang="ar">mA wlRAhm</foreign> is not a fact agreed upon: moreover, if it be conceded, still continuance is inferred from the aor.; like as when you say, <foreign lang="ar">fulaAnN yaqoriI AlDRayofa</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">yaSonaEu Aljamiyla</foreign>, you mean that it is his custom to do thus. (Mughnee.) Z asserts that when it is prefixed to a verb signifying what is liked or disliked, it denotes that the event will inevitably happen: i. e., when it is prefixed to a verb signifying a promise or a threat, it corroborates and confirms its meaning. (Mughnee.)

(Msb.) The saying of Mohammad mentioned above was uttered on the following occasion: Keys Ibn-'Ásim El-Minkaree and EzZibrikán Ibn-Bedr and 'Amr Ibn-El-Ahtam came to the Prophet, who asked 'Amr respecting EzZibrikán; whereupon he spoke well of him: but Ez-Zibrikán was not content with this, and said, “ By God, O apostle of God, he knows that I am more excellent than he has said; but he envies the place that I have in thine estimation: ” and thereupon 'Amr spoke ill of him; and then said, “ By God, I did not lie of him in the first saying nor in the other; but he pleased me, and I spoke as pleased; then he angered me, and I spoke as angered: ” then Mohammad uttered the above-mentioned words. (TA.) Their meaning is, but God knows best, he praises the man, speaking truth respecting him, so as to turn the hearts of the hearers to him, (K,) or to what he says; (TA;) and he dispraises him, speaking truth respecting him, so as to turn their hearts also to him, (K,) or to what he says after.

(S, TA.) Accord. to I'Ab, it signifies <foreign lang="ar">HujRap</foreign> wherever it occurs in the Kur. (TA.) But in the words of the Kur [xvii. 35], <foreign lang="ar">faqado jaEalonaA liwalRiyihi suloTaAnFA</foreign>, the meaning may be either [<hi>We have given to his executor,</hi> or <hi>heir,</hi>] <hi>authority, and power,</hi> or <hi>absolute authority and power,</hi> or <hi>the like;</hi> or <hi>a plea,</hi> or <hi>the like.</hi> (Mgh.)

(S, Msb.) It is also, itself, sometimes used as a pl.; as in the phrase <foreign lang="ar">sayRidu AlsRuloTaAni</foreign>, used by a poet, meaning <foreign lang="ar">sayRidu AlsRalaATiyna</foreign> [<hi>The lord of kings</hi>]; i. e. <hi>the khaleefeh:</hi> [but this may be rendered <hi>the lord of sovereign power,</hi> &amp;c.:] or, as some say, the latter word is here pl. of <foreign lang="ar">saliyTN</foreign>, like as <foreign lang="ar">rugofaAnN</foreign> is pl. of <foreign lang="ar">ragiyfN</foreign>.
