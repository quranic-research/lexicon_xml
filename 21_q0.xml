								<hi>The twenty-first letter of the alphabet:</hi> called <foreign lang="ar">qaAfN</foreign>. Respecting its pronunciation as the title of the fiftieth chapter of the Kur-án, see <foreign lang="ar">SAd</foreign>, in art. <foreign lang="ar">Swd</foreign>. It is one of the letters termed <foreign lang="ar">majohuwrap</foreign> [or vocal, i. e. pronounced with the voice, and not with the breath only]; its place of utterance is between the root of the tongue and the uvula, in the furthest part of the mouth; and it is of the strongest of the letters, and of the most certain of them in sound. (TA at the commencement of <foreign lang="ar">bAb AlqAf</foreign>.) It is sometimes pronounced like the Pers. <foreign lang="ar">G</foreign>, i. e. <foreign lang="ar">AlkaAfu Almamozuwjapu biAlqaAfi</foreign>; in which case it is termed <foreign lang="ar">AlqaAfu AlmaqoEuwdapu</foreign> [?]: this mode of pronouncing it is well known as of the dial. of the people of El-Yemen [and others]: Ibn-Khaldoon says that it is of the dial. of Mudar; and that some of the people of the [Prophet's] house are so extravagant as to assert that recitation in prayer is not rightly but with this letter thus pronounced. (MF and TA voce <foreign lang="ar">julRanaArN</foreign>.) It has been substituted for one letter, i. e. <foreign lang="ar">k</foreign>, [as some say,] in the instance of <foreign lang="ar">Oukonapu AlTRaAYiri</foreign> [for which they sometimes said <foreign lang="ar">Ouqonap</foreign>]. (MF and TA at the commencement of <foreign lang="ar">bAb AlqAf</foreign>. [It is there added that a pl. of <foreign lang="ar">Oukonap</foreign> has been heard, but not of <foreign lang="ar">Ouqonap</foreign>, and this is a sign of the originality of the former: but <foreign lang="ar">OuqanaAtN</foreign> is mentioned as pl. of <foreign lang="ar">Ouqonap</foreign> in art. <foreign lang="ar">Aqn</foreign> in the TA.])

								<foreign lang="ar">Hasobu</foreign>; (S, O, Mughnee, K;) generally used indeclinably; (Mughnee, K;) thus accord. to the Basrees; with the <foreign lang="ar">d</foreign> quiescent; (TA;) because resembling <foreign lang="ar">qado</foreign> the particle in respect of the letters composing it, and many other particles in respect of its form, (Mughnee, TA,) such as <foreign lang="ar">Eano</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">balo</foreign> &amp;c.: (TA:) one says, <foreign lang="ar">qado zayodK dirohamN</foreign> [<hi>The sufficiency of Zeyd</hi> (i. e. <hi>what is sufficient for Zeyd</hi>) <hi>is a dirhem</hi>], (Mughnee, K,) with the <foreign lang="ar">d</foreign> quiescent; (Mughnee, * K, * TA;) and <foreign lang="ar">qadiI</foreign> (S, O) and <foreign lang="ar">qadoniI</foreign> (S, O, Mughnee) [both] meaning <foreign lang="ar">HasobiI</foreign> [<hi>My sufficiency</hi> (i. e. <hi>what is sufficient for me</hi>)]; (S, O;) the <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign> in <foreign lang="ar">qadoniI</foreign> being inserted in order to preserve the quiescence [of the final letter of the noun] because this is the original characteristic of what they make indeclinable; (Mughnee;) but the insertion of the <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign> in this case is anomalous, for it is [by rule] only added in verbs, by way of precaution, [to prevent the confusion of the pronominal affix of the verb and that of the noun,] as in <foreign lang="ar">DarabaniI</foreign>: (S, O:) [see, however, in the next sentence, an explanation of <foreign lang="ar">qadoniI</foreign> accord. to which the <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign> is inserted regularly:] accord. to Yaakoob, using <foreign lang="ar">qado</foreign> in the sense of <foreign lang="ar">Hasobu</foreign>, one says, <foreign lang="ar">maA laka EinodiI UilRaA</foreign> 
								<foreign lang="ar">hecaA faqado</foreign> i. e. <foreign lang="ar">faqaTo</foreign> [<hi>There is nothing for thee with me,</hi> or <hi>nothing due to thee in my possession, except this, and it is a thing sufficient,</hi> or <hi>it is enough,</hi> 
								<foreign lang="ar">faqaTo</foreign> being held to signify properly <foreign lang="ar">faHasobu</foreign>, but it is commonly used as meaning <hi>and no more</hi>]; and he asserts it [i. e. <foreign lang="ar">qado</foreign>] to be a substitute [for <foreign lang="ar">qaTo</foreign>]: (M:) and it is also used declinably; (Mughnee, K;) thus accord. to the Koofees; (TA;) but this is rare: (Mughnee:) one says <foreign lang="ar">qadu zayodK</foreign>, making it marfooa, (Mughnee, K,) like as one says <foreign lang="ar">Hasobuhu</foreign>; and <foreign lang="ar">qadiI</foreign> without <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign> [as mentioned above,] like as one says <foreign lang="ar">HasobiI</foreign>. (Mughnee.)

								(2) It is also a verbal noun, <hi>syn. with</hi> 
								<foreign lang="ar">yakofiI</foreign>: one says, <foreign lang="ar">qado zayodFA dirohamN</foreign> [<hi>A dirhem suffices,</hi> or <hi>will suffice, Zeyd</hi>], and <foreign lang="ar">qadoniI dirohamN</foreign> [<hi>A dirhem suffices,</hi> or <hi>will suffice, me</hi>]; (Mughnee, K;) like as one says <foreign lang="ar">yakofiI zayodFA</foreign>

							As a particle, it is used peculiarly with a verb, (Mughnee, K,) [i. e.] as such it is not preposed to anything except a verb, (S, O,) either a pret. or an aor., (TA,) from which it is not separated unless by an oath, (Mughnee,) such as is perfectly inflected, enunciative, (Mughnee, K,) not an imperative, (TA,) affirmative, and free from anything that would render it mejzoom or man- soob, and from what is termed <foreign lang="ar">Harof tanofiys</foreign> [i. e. <foreign lang="ar">sawofu</foreign> and its variants]: and it has six meanings. (Mughnee, K.)
						―
						-b2-
								(1) It denotes expectation: (M, Mughnee, K:) and when it is with an aor., this is evident; (Mughnee;) one says <foreign lang="ar">qado yaqodamu</foreign> 
								<foreign lang="ar">AlgaAYibu</foreign>, (Mughnee, K,) meaning <hi>It is expected that the absent will come:</hi> (TA:) and most affirm that it is thus used with a pret.: (Mughnee:) accord. to some, (M,) it is used in reply to the saying <foreign lang="ar">lamRaA yafoEalo</foreign> [i. e. “ He has not yet done ” such a thing, which implies expectation that he would do it]; (S, M, O;) the reply being, <foreign lang="ar">qadofaEala</foreign> [<hi>Already he has done</hi> the thing]: (M:) and Kh asserts that it is used in reply to persons expecting information; (S, M, * O, Mughnee;) [for to such] you say, <foreign lang="ar">qado maAta falaAnN</foreign> [<hi>Already such a one has died</hi>]; but if one inform him who does not expect it, he does not say thus, but he says [merely] <foreign lang="ar">maAta fulaAnN</foreign>: (S, O:) thus some say <foreign lang="ar">qado rakiba AlOamiyru</foreign> [<hi>Already the commander has mounted</hi> his horse] to him who expects his mounting: some, however, disallow that <foreign lang="ar">qado</foreign> is used to denote expectation with the pret. because the pret. denotes what is already past; and hence it appears that those who affirm it to be so used mean that the pret. denotes what was expected before the information: (Mughnee: [in which it is added, with some other observations, that, in the opinion of its author, it does not denote expectation even with the aor.; because the saying <foreign lang="ar">yaqodamu AlgaYibu</foreign> denotes expectation without <foreign lang="ar">qado</foreign>:]) MF says, What we have been orally taught by the sheykhs in ElAndalus is this, that it is a particle denoting the affirmation of truth, or certainty, when it occurs before a pret., and a particle denoting expectation when it occurs before a future. (TA.)

						-b3-
								(2) It denotes the nearness of the past to the present: (O, Mughnee, K:) so in the saying <foreign lang="ar">qado qaAma zayodN</foreign> [<hi>Zeyd has just,</hi> or <hi>just now, stood;</hi> a meaning often intended by saying merely, <hi>has stood</hi>]; (Mughnee, K;) for this phrase without <foreign lang="ar">qd</foreign> may mean the near past and the remote past; (Mughnee;) and so in the saying of the muëdhdhin, <foreign lang="ar">qado qaAmati AlSRalaApu</foreign> [<hi>The time of the rising to prayer has just come,</hi> or simply <hi>has come</hi>]: (O:) [and, when thus used, it is often immediately preceded by the pret. or aor. of the verb <foreign lang="ar">kaAna</foreign>; thus you say, <foreign lang="ar">kaAna qado cahaba</foreign> 
								<hi>He had just,</hi> or simply <hi>had, gone away;</hi> and <foreign lang="ar">yakuwnu qado cahaba</foreign> 
								<hi>He will,</hi> or <hi>shall, have just,</hi> or simply <hi>have gone away:</hi>] and accord. to the Basrees, except Akh, it must be either expressed or understood immediately before a pret. used as a denotative of state; as in [the saying in the Kur ii. 247,] <foreign lang="ar">wamaA lanaA OalRaA nuqaAtilu fiI sabiyli QllRehi waqado OuxorijonaA mino diyaArinaA</foreign> 
								<foreign lang="ar">waOabonaAYinaA</foreign> [<hi>And what reason have we that we should not fight in the cause of God when we have been expelled from our abodes and our children?</hi>]; and in [the saying in the Kur iv. 92,] <foreign lang="ar">Oawo jaAWuwkumo</foreign> 
								<foreign lang="ar">HaSirato Suduwruhumo Ono yuqaAtiluwkamo</foreign> [<hi>Or who come to you, their bosoms being contracted so that they</hi>
						<pb n="2491"/> 
								<hi>are incapable of fighting you,</hi> or <hi>their bosoms shrinking from fighting you</hi>]; but the Koofees and Akh says that this is not required, because of the frequent occurrence of the pret. as a denotative of state without <foreign lang="ar">qado</foreign>, and [because] the primary rule is that there should be no meaning, or making, anything to be understood, more especially in the case of that which is in frequent use: (Mughnee:) Sb [however] does not allow the use of the pret. as a denotative of state without <foreign lang="ar">qado</foreign>; and he makes <foreign lang="ar">HSrt Sdwrhm</foreign> to be an imprecation [meaning <hi>may their bosoms become contracted</hi>]: (S in art. <foreign lang="ar">HSr</foreign>; in which art. in the present work see more on this subject:) and the inceptive <foreign lang="ar">la</foreign> is prefixed to it like of the saying, <foreign lang="ar">UinRa zayodFA laqado qaAma</foreign> [<hi>Verily Zeyd has just stood,</hi> or <hi>has stood</hi>]; because the primary rule is that it is to be prefixed to the noun, and it is prefixed to the aor. because it resembles the noun, and when the pret. denotes a time near to the present it resembles the aor. and therefore it is allowable to prefix it thereto. (Mughnee.) [See also the two sentences next after what is mentioned below as the sixth meaning.]

								(3) It denotes rareness, or paucity; (Mughnee, K;) either of the act signified by the verb, (Mughnee,) as in [the saying], <foreign lang="ar">qado yaSoduqu Alkacuwbu</foreign> [<hi>In some few instances the habitual liar speaks truth</hi>]; (Mughnee, K;) or of what is dependent upon that act, as in [the saying in the Kur xxiv. last verse,] <foreign lang="ar">qado yaEolamu maA</foreign> 
								<foreign lang="ar">Oanotumo Ealayohi</foreign> [as though] meaning <foreign lang="ar">OanRa maA humo Ealayohi huwa</foreign> 
								<foreign lang="ar">OaqalRu maEoluwmaAtihi</foreign> [so that it should be rendered <hi>At least He knoweth that</hi> state of conduct and mind <hi>to which ye are conforming yourselves</hi>]: but some assert that in these exs. and the like thereof it denotes the affirmation of truth, or certainty; [as will be shown hereafter;] and that the denoting of rareness, or paucity, in the former ex. is not inferred from <foreign lang="ar">qado</foreign>, but from the saying <foreign lang="ar">Alkacuwbu</foreign> 
								<foreign lang="ar">yaSoduqN</foreign>. (Mughnee.)

								[<hi>Often I leave the antagonist having his fingers' ends become yellow</hi>]. (S, M, O, Mughnee, K.)
						―

								(5) It denotes the affirmation of truth, or certainty: thus in [the saying in the Kur xci. 9,] <foreign lang="ar">qado OafolaHa mano zakRaAhaA</foreign> [<hi>Verily,</hi> or <hi>certainly,</hi> or <hi>indeed,</hi> or <hi>really, he prospereth,</hi> or <hi>will prosper, who purifieth it;</hi> (namely, his soul;) each pret. here occupying the place of a mejzoom aor.]: (Mughnee, K:) and thus accord. to some in [the saying in the Kur xxiv. last verse, of which another explanation has been given above,] <foreign lang="ar">qado</foreign> 
								<foreign lang="ar">yaEolamu maA Oanotumo Ealayohi</foreign> [<hi>Verily,</hi> or <hi>certainly,</hi> &amp;c., <hi>He knoweth that</hi> state of conduct and mind <hi>to which ye are conforming yourselves</hi>]. (Mughnee.)

								(6) It denotes negation, (Mughnee, K,) accord. to ISd, (Mughnee,) occupying the place of <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign>, (M,) in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">qado kunota fiI xayorK fataEorifahu</foreign>, (M, Mughnee, K,) with <foreign lang="ar">tErf</foreign> mansoob, [as though meaning <hi>Thou wast not in prosperity, that thou shouldst know it,</hi>] (Mughnee, K,) heard from one of the chaste in speech: (M:) but this is strange. (Mughnee.)
						―
						-b8-
								[When it is used to denote the nearness of the past to the present, as appears to be indicated by the context in the O,] <foreign lang="ar">qado</foreign> may be separated from the verb by an oath; as in <foreign lang="ar">qado waQllRehi OaHosanota</foreign> [<hi>Thou hast, by God, done well</hi>] and <foreign lang="ar">qado laEamoriI bitRu saAhirFA</foreign> [<hi>I have, by my life,</hi> or <hi>by my religion, passed the night sleepless</hi>]. (O, Mughnee. [In the latter, this and what here next follows are mentioned before the explanations of the meanings of the particle; probably because the meaning in these cases can hardly be mistaken.]) And the verb may be suppressed after it, (M, * O, Mughnee,) when its meaning is apprehended, (O,) or because of an indication; (Mughnee;) as in the saying of En-Nábighah (M, O, Mughnee) Edh-Dhubyánee, (O,)

							If you make <foreign lang="ar">qado</foreign> an <foreign lang="ar">Aisom</foreign> [i. e. a subst. or a proper name], you characterize it by teshdeed: therefore you say, <foreign lang="ar">katabotu qadRFA HasanapF</foreign> [<hi>I wrote a beautiful</hi> 
								<foreign lang="ar">qd</foreign>]; and so you do in the case of <foreign lang="ar">kaIo</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">huwa</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">lawo</foreign>; because these words have no indication of what is deficient in them [supposing them to be originally of three radical letters], therefore it is requisite to add to the last letter of each what is of the same kind as it, and this is incorporated into it: but not in the case of <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign>; for in this case you add <foreign lang="ar">C</foreign>; thus if you name a man <foreign lang="ar">laA</foreign>, or <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign>, and then add at the end of it <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign>, you make it <foreign lang="ar">C</foreign>; for you make the second <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> movent, and <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> when movent becomes <foreign lang="ar">C</foreign>: (S, O:) so says J, [and Sgh has followed him in the O,] and such is the opinion of Akh and of a number of the grammarians of El-Basrah [and of El-Koofeh (MF)], and F has quoted this passage in the B and left it uncontradicted: but IB says, (TA,) [and after him F in the K,] this is a mistake: that only is characterized by teshdeed of which the last letter is infirm: you say, for <foreign lang="ar">huwa</foreign>, (IB, K,) used as the name of a man, (IB,) <foreign lang="ar">huwRN</foreign>, (IB, K,) and for <foreign lang="ar">lawo</foreign> you say <foreign lang="ar">lawRN</foreign>, and for <foreign lang="ar">fiI</foreign> you say <foreign lang="ar">fiIRN</foreign>; (IB;) and such is characterized by teshdeed only in order that the word may not be reduced to one letter on account of the quiescence of the infirm letter [which would disappear] with tenween [as it does in <foreign lang="ar">damN</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">yadN</foreign> &amp;c.]: (K:) but as to <foreign lang="ar">qado</foreign>, if you use it as a name, you say <foreign lang="ar">qadN</foreign>; (IB, K;) and for <foreign lang="ar">mano</foreign> you say <foreign lang="ar">manN</foreign>, and for <foreign lang="ar">Eano</foreign> you say <foreign lang="ar">EanN</foreign>; (K;) like <foreign lang="ar">yadN</foreign> (IB, K) and <foreign lang="ar">damN</foreign> &amp;c.: (K:) F, however, [following IB,] is wrong in calling J's statement a mistake; though the rule given by him [and IB] is generally preferred.
