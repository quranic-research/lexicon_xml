                  <hi>The first letter of the alphabet</hi> [according to the order in which the letters are now commonly disposed; and also according to the original order, which see in art. <foreign lang="ar">Abjd</foreign>]: called <foreign lang="ar">A^alifN</foreign>. [This name, like most of the other names of Arabic letters, is traceable to the Phœnician language, in which it signifies “an ox;” the ancient Phœnician form of the letter thus called being a rude representation of an ox's head.] It is, of all the letters, that which is most frequent in speech: and some say that, in <foreign lang="ar">A=l=m=</foreign>, in the Kur [ch. ii. &amp;c.], it is a name of God. (TA.) Its name is properly fem., as is also that of every other letter; [and hence its pl. is <foreign lang="ar">A^alifaAtN</foreign>;] but it may be made masc.: so says Ks: Sb says that all the letters of the alphabet are masc. and fem., like as <foreign lang="ar">Al~isaAnN</foreign> is masc. and fem. (M.) As a letter of the alphabet, it is abbreviated, [or short, and is written <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign>, as it also is generally when occurring in a word, except at the end, when, in certain cases, it is written <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign>,] and is pronounced with a pause after it: and it is also prolonged: (S, K, * TA:) [in the latter case, it is written <foreign lang="ar">A='N</foreign>; and] this is the case when it is made a subst.: and when it is not called a letter, [i. e. when one does not prefix to it the word <foreign lang="ar">Harof</foreign>,] it is [properly] fem. (S.) Its dim. is <foreign lang="ar">A^uyay~apN</foreign>, meaning <hi>an</hi> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">A'</foreign> 
                  <hi>written small,</hi> or <hi>obscure,</hi> (S, IB,) according to those who make it fem. and who say, <foreign lang="ar">zay~ayatu zaAyFA</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">*ay~alotu *aAlFA</foreign>; but <foreign lang="ar">A^uway~apN</foreign> according to those who say, <foreign lang="ar">zaw~ayotu zaAyFA</foreign>. (IB.)       -A2-  <foreign lang="ar">A^alifN</foreign> [properly so called] is <hi>one of the letters of prolongation</hi> and <hi>of softness</hi> and <hi>of augmentation;</hi> the letters of augmentation being ten, which are comprised in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">Alyawoma tanosaAhu</foreign> [“to-day thou wilt forget it”]. (S.) There are two species of <foreign lang="ar">Alf</foreign>; namely, <foreign lang="ar">lay~inapN</foreign> [or <hi>soft</hi>], and <foreign lang="ar">mutaHar~ikapN</foreign> [or <hi>movent</hi>]; the former of which is [properly] called <foreign lang="ar">A^alifN</foreign>; and the latter, <foreign lang="ar">hamozapN</foreign>; (S, TA;) which is a faucial letter, pronounced in the furthest part of the fauces [by a sudden emission of the voice after a total suppression, so that it resembles in sound a feebly-uttered <foreign lang="ar">E</foreign> whence the form of the character (<foreign lang="ar">'</foreign>) whereby it is represented]: but this latter is sometimes tropically called <foreign lang="ar">Alf</foreign>; and both [as shown above] are of the letters of augmentation. (S in art. <foreign lang="ar">Aw</foreign>, and TA.) There are also two other species of <foreign lang="ar">Alf</foreign>; namely, <foreign lang="ar">A^alifu waSolK</foreign> [<hi>the alif of conjunction</hi> or <hi>connexion,</hi> or <hi>the conjunctive</hi> or <hi>connexive alif</hi>]; and <foreign lang="ar">A^alifu qaToEK</foreign> [<hi>the alif of disjunction,</hi> or <hi>the disjunctive alif</hi>]; every one that is permanent in the connexion of words being of the latter species; and that which is not permanent, [i. e. which is not pronounced, unless it is an alif of prolongation,] of the former species; and this is without exception augmentative; [but it is sometimes a substitute for a suppressed radical letter, as in <foreign lang="ar">A@bonN</foreign>, originally <foreign lang="ar">banaYN</foreign> or <foreign lang="ar">banawN</foreign>;] whereas the alif of disjunction is sometimes augmentative, as in the case of the interrogative alif [to be mentioned below, and in other cases]; and sometimes radical, as in <foreign lang="ar">A^axa*a</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">A^amara</foreign>: (S, TA:) or, according to Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà and Mohammad Ibn-Yezeed, (T, TA,) the primary <foreign lang="ar">A^alifaAt</foreign> are three; the rest being subordinate to these: namely, <foreign lang="ar">A^alifN A^aSoliy~apN</foreign> [<hi>radical alif</hi>], (T, K, TA,) as in <foreign lang="ar">A_ilofN</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">A^akala</foreign> (T) and <foreign lang="ar">A^axa*a</foreign>; (K;) and <foreign lang="ar">A^alifN qaToEiyapN</foreign> [<hi>disjunctive alif</hi>], as in <foreign lang="ar">A^aHomadu</foreign> (T, K) and <foreign lang="ar">A^aHomaru</foreign> (T) and <foreign lang="ar">A^aHosana</foreign>; (T, K;) and <foreign lang="ar">A^alifN waSoliy~apN</foreign> [<hi>conjunctive</hi> or <hi>connexive alif</hi>], (T, K,) as in <foreign lang="ar">A@sotaxoraAjN</foreign> (T) and <foreign lang="ar">A@sotaxoraja</foreign>. (T, K.) ―         -b2-  The <foreign lang="ar">A^alif</foreign> which is one of the letters of prolongation and of softness is called <foreign lang="ar">AlA^alifu AlhaAdiy^apu</foreign> [<hi>the quiescent alif,</hi> and <foreign lang="ar">AlA^alifu Als~aAkinapu</foreign>, which signifies the same]: (MF, TA:) it is an aerial letter, (Mughnee, MF, TA,) merely a sound of prolongation after a fet-hah; (T, TA;) and cannot have a vowel, (IB, Mughnee, MF,) wherefore it cannot commence a word: (Mughnee:) when they desire to make it movent, if it is converted from <foreign lang="ar">w</foreign> or <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign>, they restore it to its original, as in <foreign lang="ar">EaSawaAni</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">raHayaAni</foreign>; and if it is not converted from <foreign lang="ar">w</foreign> or <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign>, they substitute for it hemzeh, as in <foreign lang="ar">rasaAy^ilu</foreign>, in which the hemzeh is a substitute for the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> in [the sing.] <foreign lang="ar">rasaAlapN</foreign>. (IB.) IJ holds that the name of this letter is <foreign lang="ar">laA</foreign>, [pronounced <hi>lá</hi> or <hi>lé,</hi> without, or with, imáleh, like the similar names of other letters, as <foreign lang="ar">baA</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">tA</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">vaA</foreign> &amp;c.,] and that it is the letter which is mentioned [next] before <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign> in reckoning the letters; the <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign> being prefixed to it because it cannot be pronounced at the beginning of its name, as other letters can, as, for instance, <foreign lang="ar">S</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">j</foreign>; and he adds that the teachers [in schools] err in pronouncing its name <foreign lang="ar">laAma A@lifo</foreign>. (Mughnee.) ―         -b3-  The grammarians have other particular appellations for alifs, which will be here mentioned. (T, TA.) ―         -b4-  <foreign lang="ar">AlA^alifu Almajohuwlapu</foreign> [<hi>The unknown alif</hi>] is such as that in <foreign lang="ar">faAEilN</foreign> [or <foreign lang="ar">faAEala</foreign>] and <foreign lang="ar">faAEuwlN</foreign>; i. e., every <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign>, (T, K,) of those having no original [from which they are converted, not being originally <foreign lang="ar">A^</foreign> nor <foreign lang="ar">w</foreign> nor <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign>, but being merely a formative letter, and hence, app., termed “unknown”], (T,) inserted for the purpose of giving fulness of sound to the fet-hah in a verb and in a noun; (T, K;) and this, when it becomes movent, becomes <foreign lang="ar">w</foreign>, as in the case of <foreign lang="ar">xaAtamN</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">xawaAtimu</foreign>, becoming <foreign lang="ar">w</foreign> in this case because it is movent, and followed by a quiescent <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign>, which <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> is the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> of the pl., and is also <foreign lang="ar">mjhwlp</foreign>. (T.) ―         -b5-  <foreign lang="ar">A^alifaAtu Almad~aAti</foreign> [<hi>The alifs of prolongations</hi>] are such as those [which are inserted for the same purpose of giving fulness of sound to the fet-hah] in <foreign lang="ar">kalokaAlN</foreign>, for <foreign lang="ar">kalokalN</foreign>, and <foreign lang="ar">xaAtaAmN</foreign>, for <foreign lang="ar">xaAtamN</foreign>, and <foreign lang="ar">daAnaAqN</foreign>, for <foreign lang="ar">daAnaqN</foreign>. (T, K.) In like manner, <foreign lang="ar">w</foreign> is inserted after a dammeh, as in <foreign lang="ar">A^anoZuwru</foreign>; and <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign> after a kesreh, as in <foreign lang="ar">$iymaAlN</foreign>. (TA.) An alif of this species is also called <foreign lang="ar">A^alifu AlA_i$obaAEi</foreign> [<hi>The alif added to give fulness of sound</hi> to a fet-hah preceding it]: and so is the alif in <foreign lang="ar">manaA</foreign> used in imitation [of a noun in the accus. case; as when one says, <foreign lang="ar">raA^ayotu rajulFA</foreign> (pronounced <foreign lang="ar">rajulaA</foreign>) “I saw a man,” and the person to whom these words are addressed says, <foreign lang="ar">manaA</foreign> 
                  <hi>Whom?</hi>]. (Mughnee.) ―         -b6-  <foreign lang="ar">A^alifu AlS~ilapi</foreign> [<hi>The alif of annexation,</hi> or <hi>the annexed alif,</hi>] is that which is an annex to the fet-hah of a rhyme, (T, K,) and to that of the fem. pronoun <foreign lang="ar">haA</foreign>: in the former case as in <quote>
                     <L>
                        <foreign lang="ar">baAnato suEaAdu waA^amosaY HaboluhaA A@noqaTaEaA</foreign>
                     </L> 
                  </quote> in which <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> is made an annex to the fet-hah of the <foreign lang="ar">E</foreign> [of the rhyme]; and in the saying in the Kur [xxxiii. 10], <foreign lang="ar">wataZun~uwna biA@ll~`hi AlZ~unuwnaA</foreign>, in which the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> after the last <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign> is an annex to the fet-hah of that <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign>; and in other instances in the final words of verses of the Kur-án, as <foreign lang="ar">qawaAriyra</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">salosabiylaA</foreign> [in lxxvi. 15 and 18]: in the other case as in <foreign lang="ar">DarabotuhaA</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">mararotu bihaA</foreign>. (T.) The difference between it and <foreign lang="ar">A^alifu AlwaSoli</foreign> is, that the latter is in the beginnings of nouns and verbs, and the former is in the endings of nouns [and verbs]. (T, K.) It is also called <foreign lang="ar">A^alifu AlA_iTolaAqi</foreign> [<hi>The alif of unbinding,</hi> because the vowel ending a rhyme prevents its being <foreign lang="ar">muqay~d</foreign>, i. e. “bound” by the preceding consonant]: (Mughnee;) and <foreign lang="ar">A^alifu AlfaASilapi</foreign> [<hi>the alif of the final word of a verse of poetry</hi> or <hi>of a verse of the Kur-án</hi> or <hi>of a clause of rhyming prose</hi>]. (TA.) [This last appellation must not be confounded with that which here next follows.] ―         -b7-  <foreign lang="ar">AlA^alifu AlfaASilapi</foreign> [<hi>The separating alif</hi>] is the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> which is written after the <foreign lang="ar">w</foreign> of the pl. to make a separation between that <foreign lang="ar">w</foreign> and what follows it, as in <foreign lang="ar">$akaruwA</foreign> (T, K) and <foreign lang="ar">kafaruwA</foreign>, and in the like of <foreign lang="ar">yagozuwA</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">yadoEuwA</foreign> [and <foreign lang="ar">yaroDawoA</foreign>]; but when a pronoun is affixed to the verb, this <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign>, being needless, does not remain: (T:) also the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> which makes a separation between the <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign> which is a sign of the fem. gender and the heavy [or doubled] <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign> [in the corroborated form of the aor. and imperative], (T, K,) because a triple combination of <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign> is disliked, (T,) as in [<foreign lang="ar">yafoEalonaAn~i</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">tafoEalonaAn~i</foreign> and] <foreign lang="ar">AifoEalonaAn~i</foreign> (T, K) and <foreign lang="ar">laA tafoEalonaAn~i</foreign>. (T.) ―         -b8-  <foreign lang="ar">A^alifu Aln~uwni Alxafiyfapi</foreign> [<hi>The alif of the light,</hi> or <hi>single, noon</hi> in the contracted corroborated form of the aor. and imperative], as in the phrase in the Kur [xcvi. 15], <foreign lang="ar">lanasofaEFA biAln~aASiyapi</foreign> [explained in art. <foreign lang="ar">sfE</foreign>], (T, K,) and the phrase [in xii. 32], <foreign lang="ar">walayakuwnFA mina AlS~aAgiriyna</foreign> [<hi>And he shall assuredly be of those in a state of vileness,</hi> or <hi>ignominy</hi>], in both of which instances the pause is made with <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> [only, without tenween, so that one says <foreign lang="ar">lanasofaEaA</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">layakuwnaA</foreign>, and this seems to be indicated in Expositions of the Kur-án as the proper pronunciation of these two words in the phrases here cited, the former of which, and the first word of the latter, <pb n="2"/> I find thus written in an excellent copy of the Mughnee, with a fet-hah only instead of tenween, though I find them written in copies of the Kur-án and of the K with tenween, and for this reason only I have written them therewith in the first places above], this <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> being a substitute for the light <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign>, which is originally the heavy <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign>: and among examples of the same is the saying of El-Aashà, <quote>
                     <L>
                        <foreign lang="ar">walaAtaHomida Almuvoriyna waA@ll~`ha faA@HomadaA</foreign>

(EM p. 4.) ―         -b9-  <foreign lang="ar">A^alifu AlEiwaDi</foreign> [<hi>The alif of exchange</hi>] is that which is substituted for the tenween (T, K) of the accus. case when one pauses upon it, (T,) as in <foreign lang="ar">raA^ayotu zayodaA</foreign> (T, K [and so in the copy of the Mughnee mentioned above, but in the copies of the T I find <foreign lang="ar">zayodFA</foreign>,]) and <foreign lang="ar">faEalotu xayoraA</foreign> and the like. (T.) ―         -b10-  <foreign lang="ar">A^alifu Alt~aEaAyiY</foreign> [<hi>The alif of inability to express what one desires to say</hi>], (T,) or <foreign lang="ar">A^alifa AltagaAbiY</foreign> [<hi>the alif of feigning negligence</hi> or <hi>heedlessness</hi>], (K,) [but the former is evidently, in my opinion, the right appellation,] is that which is added when one says <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a Eumara</foreign>, and then, being unable to finish his saying, pauses, saying <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a EumaraA</foreign>, [in the CK <foreign lang="ar">EumaraA=</foreign>,] prolonging it, desiring to be helped to the speech that should reveal itself to him, (T, K,) and at length saying <foreign lang="ar">munoTaliqN</foreign>, meaning to say, if he were not unable to express it, <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a Eumara munoTilaqN</foreign> [<hi>Verily 'Omar is going away</hi>]. (T.) The <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> in a case of this kind is [also] said to be <foreign lang="ar">lilt~a*ak~uri</foreign> [<hi>for the purpose of endeavouring to remember</hi>]; and in like manner, <foreign lang="ar">w</foreign>, when one desires to say, <foreign lang="ar">yaquwmu zayodN</foreign>, and, forgetting <foreign lang="ar">zyd</foreign>, prolongs the sound in endeavouring to remember, and says <foreign lang="ar">yaquwmuw</foreign>. (Mughnee in the sections on <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">w</foreign>.)

(TA.) [Aboo-'Alee, as cited in the M, observes that the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> (meaning the final <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign>) in <foreign lang="ar">A^abaA</foreign>, in the phrase <foreign lang="ar">laA A^abaA laka</foreign>, indicates that it is a prefixed noun, and determinate; whereas the <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign> in <foreign lang="ar">lk</foreign> together with the government exercised upon the noun by <foreign lang="ar">lA</foreign> indicates that it is, on the contrary, indeterminate, and separate from what follows it: but it seems that he was unacquainted with the dial. var. <foreign lang="ar">A^ab~aA</foreign>; for <foreign lang="ar">laA A^abaA laka</foreign> in the dial. of him who uses the form <foreign lang="ar">A^ab~aA</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="ar">A^abN</foreign> is the same grammatically as <foreign lang="ar">laA A^aba laka</foreign> in the dial. of him who uses the form <foreign lang="ar">A^abN</foreign>.] Suleymán Ibn-'Abd-El-Melik heard an Arab of the desert, in a year of drought, say, <foreign lang="ar">A^anozilo EalayonaA Algayova laA A^abaA laka</foreign>, and Suleymán put the best construction upon it, [as though it meant, <hi>Send down upon us rain: Thou hast no father</hi>], and said, I testify that He hath no father nor female companion nor offspring. (TA.) They say also, in paying honour [to a person], <foreign lang="ar">laA A^aba li$aAniy^ika</foreign>, and <foreign lang="ar">laA A^aba li$aAniy^ika</foreign>, (TA,) i. e. <hi>May thy hater have no father!</hi> or, accord. to ISk, each is a metonymical expression for <foreign lang="ar">laA A^abaA laka</foreign>. (S in art. <foreign lang="ar">$nA^</foreign>, q. v.) ―         -b4-  One also says, on the occasion of an occurrence that is approved and commended, by way of expressing wonder and praise, <foreign lang="ar">lal~ihi A^abuwka</foreign>, meaning <hi>To God, purely, is attributable</hi> [<hi>the excellence of</hi>] <hi>thy father, seeing that he begat thee a generous son, and produced the like of thee!</hi> (TA;) [or <hi>to God be attributed</hi> (<hi>the excellence of</hi>) <hi>thy father!</hi>] it means that to God [alone] belongs the power to create the like of this man [to whom it relates], from whom has proceeded this wonderful action. (Har p. 44.) ―         -b5-  And <foreign lang="ar">hiYa binotu A^abiyhaA</foreign>, meaning <hi>She resembles her father in strength of mind,</hi> or <hi>spirit, and sharpness of disposition, and in hastening,</hi> or <hi>striving to be first, to do things:</hi> said of Hafsah, by 'Áïsheh. (TA.) ―         -b6-  <foreign lang="ar">biA^abiY</foreign>, (TA,) or <foreign lang="ar">biA^abiY A^anota</foreign>, (T in art. <foreign lang="ar">bA^</foreign>,) [said to a person,] means [<foreign lang="ar">fudiyta biA^abiY</foreign> 
                  <hi>Mayest thou be ransomed with my father!</hi> (see the next sentence but one;) or] <foreign lang="ar">A^afodiyka biA^abiY</foreign> [<hi>I will ransom thee with my father</hi>]; (T ubi suprà;) or <foreign lang="ar">A^anota mafodiY~N biA^abiY</foreign> 
                  <hi>Thou art,</hi> or <hi>shalt be, ransomed with my father</hi>]; or <foreign lang="ar">fadayutuka biA^abiY</foreign> [<hi>I have</hi> in my heart <hi>ransomed thee,</hi> or <hi>I would ransom thee, with my father</hi>]; the <foreign lang="ar">b</foreign> being dependent upon a word suppressed, which, accord. to some, is a [pass. participial] noun, and accord. to others, a verb; and this word is suppressed because of the frequent usage of the phrase. (TA.) You say also, <foreign lang="ar">biA^abiY A^anota wa A^um~iY</foreign> [<hi>With my father mayest thou be ransomed, and</hi> with <hi>my mother!</hi>]. (TA.) And <foreign lang="ar">biA^abiY mano wadadt~uhu</foreign>, i. e. <foreign lang="ar">fudiYa biA^abiY mano wadadt~uhu</foreign> [<hi>May he whom I love be ransomed with my father!</hi>], meaning <hi>may he</hi> [<hi>my father</hi>] <hi>be made a ransom for him</hi> [<hi>whom I love</hi>]! (El-Wáhidee on the Deewán of El-Mutanebbee, in De Sacy's Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed. vol. iii. p. 35 of the Arabic text.) Sometimes they change the <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign> into <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign>: a poet says, <quote>

(S.) And some of the Arabs used to say, <foreign lang="ar">waA biA^abaA A^anota</foreign> [<hi>Alas, with my father mayest thou be ransomed!</hi>]: this, says AM, being like <foreign lang="ar">yaA wayolataA</foreign> for <foreign lang="ar">yaA wayolatiY</foreign>; as also <foreign lang="ar">yaA bayobaA</foreign>, with the hemzeh changed into <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign>, originally <foreign lang="ar">yaA biA^abaA</foreign>, meaning <foreign lang="ar">yaAbiA^abiY</foreign>: and hence what is related, in a trad., of Umm- 'Ateeyeh; that she used not to mention the Prophet without saying, <foreign lang="ar">biyabaA</foreign> [for <foreign lang="ar">biA^abi huwa</foreign>].

(TA.) [See also the first paragraph in art. <foreign lang="ar">bA^</foreign>.] ―         -b7-  You say also, <foreign lang="ar">yaA A^abati</foreign> [meaning <hi>O my father</hi>], (S, M, K,) as in <foreign lang="ar">yaA A^abati</foreign>

(S, M.) The <foreign lang="ar">p</foreign>, [here written <foreign lang="ar">t</foreign>,] (Kh, M,) the sign of the fem. gender, (S, Z,) is substituted for the [pronominal] affix <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign>, (Kh, S, M, Z,) as in <foreign lang="ar">yaAA^um~ati</foreign>; (S;) and is like the <foreign lang="ar">p</foreign> in <foreign lang="ar">EamapN</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">xaAlapN</foreign>, as is shown by your saying, in pausing, <foreign lang="ar">yaA A^abahN</foreign>, like as you say, <foreign lang="ar">yaA xaAlapN</foreign>: (Kh, M:) the annexing of the fem. <foreign lang="ar">t</foreign> to a masc. noun in this case is allowable, like as it is in <foreign lang="ar">HamaAmapN *akarN</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">$aApN *akarN</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">rajulN raboEapN</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">galaAmN yafaEapN</foreign>: its being made a substitute for the affix <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign> is allowable because each of these is an augmentative added at the end of a noun: and the kesreh is the same that is in the phrase <foreign lang="ar">yaA A^abiY</foreign>: (Z ubi suprà:) the <foreign lang="ar">t</foreign> does not fall from <foreign lang="ar">Ab</foreign> in the phrase <foreign lang="ar">yaA A^abati</foreign> when there is no pause after it, though it [sometimes] does from <foreign lang="ar">A^um~</foreign> in the like phrase in that case, because the former word, being of [only] two letters, is as though it were defective. (S.) <foreign lang="ar">yaA A^abata</foreign> is for <foreign lang="ar">yaA A^abataA</foreign>, (Aboo-'Othmán El-Mázinee, S, * M, [the latter expression mentioned also in the K, but not as being the original of the former,]) the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> [and <foreign lang="ar">h</foreign>] being suppressed; (the same Aboo- 'Othmán and M;) or for <foreign lang="ar">yaA A^abataA</foreign>, the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> being suppressed, like as the <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign> is in <foreign lang="ar">yaA gulaAmi</foreign>; or it may be after the manner of <foreign lang="ar">yaAA^abiYa</foreign>. (Z ubi suprà.) <foreign lang="ar">yaA A^abatu</foreign> is thus pronounced after the usual manner of a noun ending with the fem. <foreign lang="ar">p</foreign>, without regard to the fact that the <foreign lang="ar">t</foreign> is in the former a substitute for the suffix <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign>. (Z ubi suprà.) <foreign lang="ar">yaA A^abaho</foreign> is said in a case of pause, except in the Kur-án, in which, in this case, you say, <foreign lang="ar">yaA A^abaho</foreign>, following the written text; and some of the Arabs pronounce the fem. <foreign lang="ar">p</foreign>, in a case of pause, <foreign lang="ar">t</foreign> [in other instances], thus saying, <foreign lang="ar">yaA TaloHatu</foreign>. (S.) <foreign lang="ar">yaA A^abaAhu</foreign> is also said; (M, K;) though scarcely ever. (M.) A poet uses the expression <foreign lang="ar">yaA A^abaAta</foreign>, for <foreign lang="ar">yaA A^abataAho</foreign>: (S, M:) IB says that this is used only by poetic license, in a case of necessity in verse.

(Msb.) The fem. is ↓ 
      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A_iHodaY</orth> only; and this is only used in particular cases, to be shown below: (Msb:) most agree that the <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign> in this word is the characteristic of the fem. gender: but some say that it is to render it quasi-coordinate to the quadriliteral-radical class: [this, however, is inconsistent with its pronunciation, which is invariably <foreign lang="ar">A_iHodaY</foreign>, not <foreign lang="ar">A_iHod~aY</foreign>:] (TA:) its pl. is <foreign lang="ar">A_iHadN</foreign>, as though the sing. were <foreign lang="ar">A_iHodapN</foreign>, like as is said of <foreign lang="ar">*ikarN</foreign> as pl. of <foreign lang="ar">*ikoraY</foreign>: one of the expositors of the Tes-heel writes it <foreign lang="ar">A^uHadN</foreign>, with damm and then fet-h; but a pl. of this measure is not applicable to a sing. of the measure <foreign lang="ar">fiEolaY</foreign>, with kesr.

      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^uHayodaY</orth>. (L in art. <foreign lang="ar">wHd</foreign>.) ―         -b2-  It is interchangeable with <foreign lang="ar">waAHidN</foreign> in two cases: first, when it is used as an epithet applied to God: (Msb:) for <foreign lang="ar">AlA^aHadu</foreign>, as an epithet, is applied to God alone, (Msb, K,) and signifies <hi>The One; the Sole; He who has ever been one and alone:</hi> or <hi>the Indivisible:</hi> or <hi>He who has no second</hi> [<hi>to share</hi>] <hi>in his lordship, nor in his essence, nor in his attributes:</hi> (TA:) you say, <foreign lang="ar">huwa AlwaAHidu</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">huwa AlA^aHadu</foreign>: and in like manner, <foreign lang="ar">A^aHadN</foreign>, without the article, is used as an epithet specially in relation to God, and is interchangeable in this case [but not in other cases] with <foreign lang="ar">waAHidN</foreign>: therefore you do not say <foreign lang="ar">rajulN A^aHadN</foreign> nor <foreign lang="ar">dirohamN A^aHadN</foreign> and the like [but <foreign lang="ar">rajulN</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">waAHdN</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">dirhamN waAHidN</foreign> &amp;c.] (Msb.) [See also <foreign lang="ar">waAHidN</foreign>, in art. <foreign lang="ar">wHd</foreign>.] In the phrase in the Kur [cxii. 1], <foreign lang="ar">qulo huwa All~`hu A^aHadN</foreign> [<hi>Say, He is God, One</hi> God], <foreign lang="ar">A^aHadN</foreign> is a substitute for <foreign lang="ar">All~`hu</foreign>; for an indeterminate noun is sometimes a substitute for a determinate noun, as in another passage in the Kur, xcvi. 15 and 16. (S.) Secondly, it is interchangeable with <foreign lang="ar">waAHidN</foreign> in certain nouns of number: (Msb:) you say <foreign lang="ar">A^aHada Ea$ara</foreign> [masc.] and <foreign lang="ar">A_iHodaY Ea$orapa</foreign> [fem.] (S) [meaning <hi>Eleven:</hi> and in these two cases you may not substitute <foreign lang="ar">waAHidN</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">waAHidapN</foreign> for <foreign lang="ar">A^aHadN</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">A_iHodaY</foreign>: but] in <foreign lang="ar">A^aHadNwEa$oruwna</foreign> [<hi>One and twenty,</hi> and the like,] <foreign lang="ar">A^aHadN</foreign> is interchangeable with <foreign lang="ar">waAHidN</foreign>. (Msb.) Ks says, When you prefix the article <foreign lang="ar">Al</foreign> to a number, prefix it to every number; therefore you should say, <foreign lang="ar">maA faEalati AlA^aHada AlEa$ara</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">AlA^alofa Ald~irohama</foreign> [<hi>What did the eleven thousand dirhems?</hi>]: but the Basrees prefix it to the first only, and say, <foreign lang="ar">mA fElt AlA^aHada Ea$ara A^alofa dirohamK</foreign>. (S.) ―         -b3-  In [most] cases differing from these two, there is a difference in usage between <foreign lang="ar">A^aHadN</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">waAHidN</foreign>: the former is used in affirmative phrases as a prefixed noun only, governing the noun which follows it in the gen. case; [as in exs. which will be found below;] and is used absolutely in negative phrases; [as will also be seen in exs. below;] whereas <foreign lang="ar">waAHidN</foreign> is used in affirmative phrases as a prefixed noun and otherwise: the fem. <foreign lang="ar">A_iHodaY</foreign>, also, is only used as a prefixed noun, except in numbers (Msb) [and in one other instance, which see below]. Using <foreign lang="ar">A^aHadN</foreign> and its fem. in affirmative phrases as prefixed nouns, you say, <foreign lang="ar">qaAma A^aHadu Alv~alaAvapi</foreign> [<hi>One of the three stood</hi>]; and <foreign lang="ar">qaAlato A_iHodaA humaA</foreign> [<hi>One of them two</hi> (females) <hi>said</hi>]; and <foreign lang="ar">xu*o A_iHodaY</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">Alv~alaAvapi</foreign> [<hi>Take thou one of the three</hi>]. (TA.) The phrase <foreign lang="ar">A_iHodaY banaAti TabaqK</foreign> means <hi>A calamity:</hi> (K:) or, as some say, (TA, but in the K “ and, ”) <hi>a serpent;</hi> (K, TA;) so called because it twists itself round so as to become like a <foreign lang="ar">Tabaq</foreign>. (TA.) And the phrase <foreign lang="ar">A_iHodaY AlA_iHadi</foreign>, (L, K, TA,) in which the latter word has kesr to the <foreign lang="ar">A_</foreign> and fet-h to the <foreign lang="ar">H</foreign>, and is pl. of the former, also written <foreign lang="ar">AlA^uHadi</foreign>, but this form is disapproved by MF, as has been shown above, (TA, [in several copies of the K incorrectly written <foreign lang="ar">AlA^aHadi</foreign>,]) [lit. means <hi>One of the ones;</hi> and] is applied to <hi>a great,</hi> or <hi>mighty, event;</hi> (L, K, TA;) <hi>one that is difficult, distressing, grievous,</hi> or <hi>terrible.</hi> (L, TA.) You say, <foreign lang="ar">A^ataY biA_iHodaY AlA_iHadi</foreign> [the last of which words is here again written in several copies of the K <foreign lang="ar">AlA^aHadi</foreign>] <hi>He brought to pass a grievous, and great,</hi> or <hi>mighty, event,</hi> (K, TA,) when you desire to express the greatness and terribleness of an event. (TA.) You also say, <foreign lang="ar">fulaAnu A^aHadu AlA^aHadiyna</foreign>, and <foreign lang="ar">waAHidu AlA^aHadiyna</foreign>, (K, TA,) the latter in one copy of the K written <foreign lang="ar">waAHidu AlwaAHidiyna</foreign>, in which the latter word is pl. of the former, (TA,) and <foreign lang="ar">waAHidu</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">AlA=HaAdi</foreign>, and <foreign lang="ar">A_iHodaY AlA_iHadi</foreign>, (K, TA,) like a phrase before mentioned, only the former is applied to a calamity, and this to an intelligent being, and written in the two manners before mentioned, the difference being only in application, (TA, [in several copies of the K here again written <foreign lang="ar">A_iHodaY</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">AlA^aHadi</foreign>, and in the CK <foreign lang="ar">AaHadiY~u AlAaHadi</foreign>,]) and <foreign lang="ar">A_iHodaY</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">AlA^aHadiyna</foreign>, (Et-Tes-heel,) and <foreign lang="ar">A_iHodaY AlA=HaAdi</foreign>, (TA,) which are expressions of the utmost praise, (IAar, A Heyth, K,) [lit. <hi>Such a man is one of the ones;</hi> meaning] <hi>such a one is unique among the uniques;</hi> (TA;) <hi>one who has no equal; unequalled; incomparable.</hi> (IAar, Tes-heel.) It seems that the form of pl. used in the phrase <foreign lang="ar">A^aHadu AlA^aHadiyna</foreign> is used only as applied to rational beings; but it is said in the Expositions of the Tes-heel that this phrase signifies <hi>One of the calamities;</hi> the form of the rational pl. being given to nouns significant of things deemed great, mighty, or grievous. (AHeyth.) In the phrase <foreign lang="ar">A_iHodaY AlA_iHadi</foreign>, the fem. forms are said to be used for the purpose of giving intensiveness to the signification, as though the meaning were <foreign lang="ar">daAhiyapu Ald~awaAhiY</foreign>, the word <foreign lang="ar">dAhyp</foreign> being [an intensive epithet] from <foreign lang="ar">dahaA='N</foreign> as signifying intelligence, or intelligence mixed with craft or cunning and forecast; or by <foreign lang="ar">dAhyp</foreign> being meant a calamity. (Expositions of the Fs, TA.) AHei thought <foreign lang="ar">A^aHadu AlA^aHadiyna</foreign> to be an epithet applied to a male, and <foreign lang="ar">A_iHodaY AlA_iHadi</foreign> to be applied to a female: but his opinion has been refuted by EdDemámeenee in the Expos. of the Tes-heel: and this latter author there remarks, that in expressions meant to denote praise [of a man], <foreign lang="ar">A^aHadN</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">A_iHodaY</foreign> are prefixed to their own proper pls., as <foreign lang="ar">A^aHaduwna</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">A_iHadN</foreign>; or to an epithet, as in the case of <foreign lang="ar">A^aHadu AlEulamaA='i</foreign> [<hi>One of the learned</hi>]; but that they have not been heard prefixed to generic nouns.

[in this instance] <foreign lang="ar">wa A@*okuro qiS~apa maroyama</foreign> [<hi>And mention thou,</hi> or <hi>remember thou, the case of Mary</hi>]: and this assertion is strengthened by the express mention of the [proper] objective complement in [the Kur iii. 98,] <foreign lang="ar">wa A@*okurwA niEomapa A@ll~`hi Ealayokumo A_i*o kunotumo A^aEodaA='F</foreign> [<hi>And remember ye the grace of God towards you when ye were enemies</hi>]. (Mughnee.) ―         -b3-  Also, (Mughnee, K,) accord. to some, (T, Mughnee,) it is used (T, Mughnee, K) as a noun (Mughnee, K) to indicate future time, (T, Mughnee, K,) and <foreign lang="ar">A_i*aA</foreign> is said to denote past time, (T,) [i. e.] each of these occurs in the place of the other; (TA;) the former being used to indicate future time in the Kur [xxxiv. 50], where it is said, <foreign lang="ar">walawo taraY A_i*o faziEuwA</foreign> [<hi>And couldst thou see the time when they shall be terrified</hi>], meaning the day of resurrection; this usage being allowable, says Fr, only because the proposition is like one expressing a positive fact, since there is no doubt of the coming of that day; (T;) and in [the Kur xcix. 4,] <foreign lang="ar">yawomay^i*K tuHad~ivu A^axobaArahaA</foreign> [<hi>On that day, she</hi> (the earth) <hi>shall tell her tidings</hi>]; (Mughnee, K;) this being generally regarded as similar to the expression of a future event which must necessarily happen as though it had already happened; but it may be urged in favour of those who hold a different opinion that it is said in the Kur [xl. 72 and 73], <foreign lang="ar">fasawofa yaEolamuwna A_i*i AlA^aglaAlu fiY</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">A^aEonaAqihimo</foreign> [<hi>They shall hereafter know, when the collars</hi> shall be <hi>on their necks</hi>]; for <foreign lang="ar">yElmwn</foreign> is a future as to the letter and the meaning because of its having <foreign lang="ar">swf</foreign> conjoined with it, and it governs <foreign lang="ar">A*</foreign>, which is therefore in the place of <foreign lang="ar">A_i*aA</foreign>. (Mughnee.) ―         -b4-  It also indicates a cause, as in [the Kur xliii. 38,] <foreign lang="ar">lano yanofaEakumu A@loyawoma A_i*o Zalamotumo</foreign> [<hi>It will not profit you this day, since,</hi> or <hi>because, ye have acted wrongfully</hi>], (Mughnee, K,) i. e. because of your having acted wrongfully in the sublunary state of existence; (Bd, Mughnee;) but it is disputed whether it be in this instance a particle in the place of the causative <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign>, or an adverbial noun: (Mughnee:) Aboo-'Alee seems to hold that <foreign lang="ar">A* Zlmtm</foreign> [as meaning <hi>when ye have acted wrongfully</hi>] is a substitute for, or a kind of repetition of, <foreign lang="ar">Alywm</foreign>; an event happening in the present world being spoken of as though it happened in the world to come because the latter immediately follows the former. (IJ, M, L, Mughnee.) You say also, <foreign lang="ar">AlHamodu lil~`hi A_i*o jiy^ota</foreign> [<hi>Praise be to God because,</hi> or <hi>that, thou camest,</hi> or <hi>hast come</hi>].

(Mughnee, K.) Ibn-Málik adopts the first of these opinions; Ibn-'Osfoor, the second; (Mughnee;) and so El-Fenjedeehee; (TA;) and Z, the third; and he asserts that its governing word is a verb understood, derived from <foreign lang="ar">AlmufaAjaA^apu</foreign>; [agreeably with the explanation cited above from the S;] but others hold that the word which governs it in the accus. case is the enunciative, which is either expressed, as in <foreign lang="ar">xarajotu faA_i*aA zayodN</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">jaAlisN</foreign> [<hi>I went forth, and there, in that place,</hi> or <hi>then, at that time, Zeyd was sitting</hi>], or meant to be understood, as in <foreign lang="ar">faA_i*aA AlA^asadu</foreign>, i. e. <foreign lang="ar">HaADirN</foreign> [<hi>And there,</hi> or <hi>then, the lion was present</hi>]; or if it be supposed to be [itself] the enunciative, its governing word is <foreign lang="ar">musotaqir~u</foreign> or <foreign lang="ar">Aisotaqar~a</foreign> [understood]: and in the last of the phrases here mentioned, it may be an enunciative accord. to the opinion of Mbr, the meaning being <foreign lang="ar">fabiA@loHaADirapi AlA^asadu</foreign> [<hi>And among the things present was the lion</hi>]; but not accord. to the opinion of Zj, because a noun signifying time cannot be the enunciative of one signifying a corporeal thing; nor accord to the opinion of Akh, because a particle cannot be used to denote the enunciative of such a thing; or, as signifying time, it may be the enunciative of such a thing if we suppose a prefixed noun to be suppressed, the meaning of <foreign lang="ar">faA_i*aA AlA^asadu</foreign> being <foreign lang="ar">faA_i*Aa HuDuwru AlA^asadi</foreign> [<hi>And then was the presence of the lion</hi>].

(Mughnee.) ―         -b2-  It also denotes the complement of a condition, like <foreign lang="ar">fa</foreign>, (S, Msb,) with which it is in this case syn., (Msb,) as in the words of the Kur [xxx. 35], <foreign lang="ar">waA_ino tuSibohumo say~iy^apN bimaA qad~amato A^ayodiyhimo A_i*aA humu yaqonaTuwn</foreign> [<hi>And if an evil befall them for that which their hands have sent before,</hi> (i. e. for sins which they have committed,) <hi>then they despair</hi>].

                  <hi>When thou shalt come to me, it will be incumbent,</hi> or <hi>obligatory, on me to treat thee with honour</hi>]. (Mughnee.) It renders an aor. following it mansoob on certain conditions: (Mughnee, TA:) to have this effect, the aor. must have a future signification, (T, S, Mughnee, TA,) not present: (TA:) <foreign lang="ar">yajibu EalaY~a A^ano A^ukurimaka</foreign> must commence the phrase in which the aor. occurs; (Mughnee, TA;) [or, in other words,] the aor. must not be syntactically dependent upon what precedes <foreign lang="ar">A*A</foreign>: (TA:) and there must be nothing intervening between <foreign lang="ar">A*A</foreign> and the aor., (T, Mughnee, TA,) unless it is a particle, (T,) or an oath, (T, Mughnee,) or the negative <foreign lang="ar">laA</foreign>: (Mughnee:) therefore, to a person who says, “To-night I will visit thee,” (S,) or who says, “I will come to thee,” (Mughnee,) you say, <foreign lang="ar">A_i*ano A^ukorimaka</foreign> [<hi>Then,</hi> or <hi>in that case, &amp;c., I will treat thee with honour</hi>]; (T, S, Mughnee;) and to one who says, “I will treat thee with honour,” you say, <foreign lang="ar">A_i*FA A^ajiyoy^aka</foreign> [<hi>Then,</hi> or <hi>if the case be so, I will come to thee</hi>]. (TA.) When the verb after <foreign lang="ar">A*n</foreign> has the present signification, it does not govern: (S, Mughnee, TA:) therefore, to a person who says, “I love thee,” you say, <foreign lang="ar">A_i*ano A^aZun~uka</foreign> [<hi>Then,</hi> or <hi>if the case be so, I think thee veracious</hi>]; for this is a mere reply: (Mughnee:) and to one talking to thee, <foreign lang="ar">A_i*FA A^aZun~uka kaA*bFA</foreign> [<hi>Then I think thee to be lying</hi>]. (TA.) When it is put in a middle place, (S,) not commencing the phrase, (Mughnee,) the verb after it not being syntactically dependent upon what is before it, (S, TA,) it does not govern: (S, Mughnee, TA:) therefore, to one who says, “I will come to thee,” (Mughnee, TA,) you say, <foreign lang="ar">A^anaA A_i*ano A^ukorimuka</foreign> [<hi>I, in that case, will treat thee with honour</hi>]: (S, Mughnee, TA:) for <foreign lang="ar">A*n</foreign> among the words which govern verbs is likened to <foreign lang="ar">AlZ~an~u</foreign> among those which govern nouns: (S:) and when it is put at the end, it does not govern; as when you say, <foreign lang="ar">A^ukroimuka</foreign> [<hi>I will treat thee with honour in that case</hi>].

                  </quote> is explained by regarding it as an instance of the suppression of the enunciative of <foreign lang="ar">A_in~</foreign>, so that the meaning is, <foreign lang="ar">A_in~iY lAa A^aqodiru EalaY *`lika</foreign>, and then a new phrase commences [wherefore the verse means <hi>Do not thou leave me among them remote,</hi> or <hi>a stranger: verily</hi> I cannot endure that: <hi>in that case I should perish, or I should flee</hi>]. (Mughnee.) When it is immediately preceded by a conjunction such as <foreign lang="ar">wa</foreign> or <foreign lang="ar">fa</foreign>, the aor. may be either marfooa or mansoob. (S, Mughnee.) When a noun is introduced between it and the aor., the latter is marfooa, (T, Mughnee,) as in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">A_i*ano A^axuwka yukorimuka</foreign> [<hi>Then,</hi> or <hi>in that case, thy brother will treat thee with honour</hi>], (T,) or <foreign lang="ar">A_i*FA yaA Eaboda A@ll~`hi A^ukurimuka</foreign> [<hi>Then,</hi> or <hi>in that case, O ‘Abd-Allah, I will treat thee with honour</hi>]; but Ibn-’Osfoor allows the intervention of an adverbial noun [without annulling the government]; and Ibn-Bábshádh, that of the vocative, and of a prayer; and Ks and Hishám, that of a word governed by the verb; but Ks in this case prefers nasb; and Hishám, refa. (Mughnee.) When you put an oath in the place of the noun, you make the aor. mansoob, as in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">A_i*FA wa A@ll~`hi tanaAma</foreign> [<hi>Then,</hi> or <hi>if the case be so, by God, thou wilt sleep</hi>]: but if you prefix <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign> to the verb with the oath, you make the aor. marfooa, saying, <foreign lang="ar">A_*ano waA@ll~`hi latanodahum</foreign> [<hi>Then,</hi> or <hi>if the case be so, by God, assuredly thou wilt regret,</hi> or <hi>repent</hi>]. (T.) When you introduce a particle between it and the aor., you make the latter either marfooa or mansoob, saying, <foreign lang="ar">A_i*ano laA A^ukorimuka</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">laA A^ukurimaka</foreign> [<hi>Then, or in that case, I will not treat thee with honour</hi>]. (T.) ―         -b2-  Sometimes the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> is rejected, and they say, <foreign lang="ar">*ano laA A^afuEalu</foreign> [<hi>Then,</hi> (a word exactly agreeing with <foreign lang="ar">*ano</foreign> in sound as well as in meaning,) or <hi>in that case, I will not do</hi> such a thing]. (M, K, * TA.) ―         -b3-  IJ relates, on the authority of Khálid, that <foreign lang="ar">A_i*FA</foreign> is used in the dial. of Hudheyl for <foreign lang="ar">A_i*FA</foreign>. (M.) ―         -b4-  <foreign lang="ar">A_i*ano</foreign> or <foreign lang="ar">A_i*FA</foreign> is mentioned and explained in the S and K and TA in art. <foreign lang="ar">A*n</foreign>, and in the TA in <foreign lang="ar">bAb AlAlf Ally~np</foreign> also.]   </entryFree>

[In a case of this kind, it is said in the Mughnee to be redundant; but I think it is clearly not so in any of the instances here mentioned, except the last; and this I would rather assign to a category yet to be noticed, in which <foreign lang="ar">Al</foreign> is certainly redundant, and, by rule, inseparable.] ―         -b5-  It is also prefixed to a noun transferred from its original application to that of a proper name; it being so prefixed to convey an allusion to the original signification; and such noun being generally an epithet, as <foreign lang="ar">HaArivN</foreign>; but sometimes an inf. n., as <foreign lang="ar">faDolN</foreign>; and sometimes a generic noun, as <foreign lang="ar">nuEomaAnN</foreign>; so that in any of these cases you may prefix <foreign lang="ar">Al</foreign>, saying <foreign lang="ar">AlHaArivu</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">AlfaDolu</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">Aln~uEomaAnu</foreign>, with a view to the original signification; and you may suppress it, with a view to the actual state [which is that of a proper name]: for when you mean that a name of this kind is given as one ominous of good, you prefix the <foreign lang="ar">Al</foreign> in order to indicate this; as when you say <foreign lang="ar">AlHaArivu</foreign> with a view to a person's being thus named to prognosticate that he will live and be a tiller, or cultivator; but when you only consider it as a proper name, you do not prefix the <foreign lang="ar">Al</foreign>: thus the prefix <foreign lang="ar">Al</foreign> conveys a meaning not obtained without it; and therefore it is not redundant, as some assert it to be. (I 'Ak p. 50.) [The author of the Mughnee is one of those who consider <foreign lang="ar">Al</foreign> redundant in this case.] ―         -b6-  It is in some cases redundant: and in some of these, it is inseparable; as in [a proper name which cannot be used with a view to an original application from which it has been transferred to that of a proper name though it may have been so transferred, such as] <foreign lang="ar">All~aAtu</foreign>, which is the name of a certain idol that was at Mekkeh [so called because a man used to moisten <foreign lang="ar">sawiyq</foreign> with clarified butter, for the pilgrims, at the place thereof]; and, accord. to some, [as before mentioned,] in <foreign lang="ar">AlA=ni</foreign>; and in the conjunct nouns <foreign lang="ar">Al~a*iY</foreign> and its variations, accord. to those who hold that a noun of this kind is rendered determinate by its complement: in other cases, where it is redundant, it is separable; and this is when it is prefixed to a proper name by poetic licence, as in <foreign lang="ar">banaAtu AlA^awobari</foreign> for <foreign lang="ar">banaAtu A^awobara</foreign>, a species of truffle; or, accord. to Mbr, this is not a proper name, and the <foreign lang="ar">Al</foreign> is not redundant; and when it is prefixed to a specificative, as in <foreign lang="ar">Tibota Aln~afosa</foreign> for <foreign lang="ar">Tibota nafosFA</foreign>, accord. to the Basrees, who hold, in opposition to the Koofees, that the specificative may only be indeterminate; (I 'Ak p. 49;) [and, in like manner, as redundant and separable,] it is irregularly prefixed [by poetic licence] in <foreign lang="ar">AlA^amosi</foreign> [q. v.], when it is left in its original form with kesr. (T.) ―         -b7-  Accord. to the Koofees, and some of the Basrees, and many of the later authors, it may also supply the place of the affixed pronoun; and such they hold to be the case in the saying in the Kur [lxxix. 41], <foreign lang="ar">faA_in~a A@lojan~apa hiYa A@lomaA^wiY</foreign> [<hi>Verily Paradise, it shall be his place of abode</hi>]; and in <foreign lang="ar">mararotu birajulK HasanK Alwajohu</foreign> [<hi>I passed by a man beautiful in his face</hi>]; and <foreign lang="ar">Duriba zayodN AlZ~ahoru waAlbaTonu</foreign> [<hi>Zeyd was beaten, his back and his belly</hi>]; when <foreign lang="ar">Alwjh</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">AlZhr</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">AlbTn</foreign> are thus in the nom. case: but those who deny its being used in this manner hold that <foreign lang="ar">lahu</foreign> is to be understood in the verse of the Kur, and <foreign lang="ar">minohu</foreign> in the other examples: and Ibn-Málik restricts the licence to cases not including the <foreign lang="ar">Silap</foreign> [or complement of <foreign lang="ar">Al</foreign> used in the manner which is here next to be explained]. (Mughnee.) ―         -b8-  It is also a conjunct noun in the sense of <foreign lang="ar">Al~a*iY</foreign> and its variations; and as such is prefixed to an act. part. n., and to a pass. part. n., and, as some say, to a simple epithet; (Mughnee, and I' Ak p. 43;) as <foreign lang="ar">AlD~aAribu</foreign> [which is equivalent to <foreign lang="ar">Al~a*iY yaDoribu</foreign>], and <foreign lang="ar">AlmaDoruwbu</foreign> [which is equivalent to <foreign lang="ar">Al~a*iY Duriba</foreign>], and <foreign lang="ar">AlHasanu Alwajohi</foreign>: (I 'Ak:) but this last not to be regarded, as it cannot be rendered by means of a verb. (Mughnee.) As such, also, it is sometimes prefixed to an adverbial noun, (Mughnee and I 'Ak,) extraordinarily; (I 'Ak;) as in the saying, <quote>
                     <L> 
                        <foreign lang="ar">mano laA yazaAlu $aAkirFA EalaY ylomaEaho</foreign>

As such it is also sometimes prefixed to a nominal proposition; as in the saying, <quote>
                     <L> 
                        <foreign lang="ar">mana Alqawomi Alr~asuwlu A@ll~`hi minohumo</foreign>

And as such it is also sometimes prefixed to a verbal proposition, of which the verb is an aor.; which shows that it is not [in this case] a particle of determination; (Mughnee;) as in the phrase, <foreign lang="ar">Sawotu AlHimaAri Alyujad~aEu</foreign> [<hi>The voice of the ass that has his ear,</hi> or <hi>ears, cut off</hi>]. (T and Mughnee.) But all these three cases are peculiar to poetry; contrary to the opinion of Akh, and, with respect to the last case, to that of Ibn-Málik. (Mughnee.) [Respecting the last instance, see also art. <foreign lang="ar">jdE</foreign>.] Another instance of its usage prefixed in this sense to an aor. is the saying, <quote>

                  </quote> [<hi>Thou art not the judge whose judgment is approved</hi>]; (IAmb, T, I 'Ak) a saying of ElFarezdak: (IAmb, T:) it is an extraordinary case; (I 'Ak;) and is [said to be] an instance of a bad poetic license, the like of which in prose would be an error by common consent. (Expos. of the Shudhoor edh-Dhahab.) In like manner, one says, accord. to AZ, <foreign lang="ar">h`*aA AlyaDoribuka</foreign>, meaning <hi>This is he who beats thee;</hi> and <foreign lang="ar">raA^ayotu AlyaDoribuka</foreign>

(The same in the beginning of the art.) First, (Mughnee,) it is used (as a particle, S, Msb,) to denote exception; [meaning <hi>Except, save,</hi> or <hi>saving;</hi> and sometimes <hi>but;</hi> and sometimes <hi>but not;</hi> as will be seen below;] (T, S, Msb, Mughnee, K; [in which last it is mentioned in art. <foreign lang="ar">Al</foreign>, and again, as in the S, in the last division of the work;]) and to denote exception, it is used in five manners; after an affirmation, and a negation, and a portion of a sentence devoid of the mention of that from which the exception is made, and when the thing excepted precedes that from which the exception is made, and when these two are disunited in kind, in which last case it has the meaning of <foreign lang="ar">l`kin~a</foreign> [<hi>but</hi> when the sentence is negative, and <hi>but not</hi> when the sentence is affirmative]. (S, TA.) You say, <foreign lang="ar">qaAma Alqawomu A_il~aA zayodFA</foreign> [<hi>The people,</hi> or <hi>company of men, stood, except Zeyd</hi>]; i. e., Zeyd was not included in the predicament of the people, or company of men: (Msb:) and it is said in the Kur [ii. 250], (T,) <foreign lang="ar">fa$aribuwA minohu A_il~aA qaliylFA minohumo</foreign> [<hi>And they drank of it, except a few of them</hi>]: (T, Mughnee, K:) here <foreign lang="ar">qlylA</foreign> is governed in the accus. case by <foreign lang="ar">Al~A</foreign>, (Mughnee, K,) accord. to the most correct opinion: (Mughnee:) accord. to Th, it is so because there is no negation in the beginning of the sentence.

And it is also said in the Kur [iv. 69], (T,) <foreign lang="ar">maA faEaluwhu A_il~aA qaliylN minohumo</foreign> [<hi>They had not done it,</hi> or <hi>they would not do it, except a few of them</hi>]: (T, Mughnee, K:) here <foreign lang="ar">qlyl</foreign> is in the nom. case as being a partial substitute, (Mughnee, K,) accord. to the Basrees, (Mughnee,) i. e., as being a [partial] substitute for the [pronoun] <foreign lang="ar">w</foreign> [in <foreign lang="ar">fElwh</foreign>], for it may here be so without perversion of the meaning, whereas it cannot be so without such perversion when the sentence is affirmative: (TA:) accord. to the Koofees, <foreign lang="ar">Al~A</foreign> is a conjunction, like the conjunctive <foreign lang="ar">laA</foreign>: (Mughnee:) accord. to Th, <foreign lang="ar">qlyl</foreign> is here in the nom. case because the sentence commences with a negative: (T:) or in a sentence [like this,] which is not affirmative, in which the thing excepted is united in kind to that from which the exception is made, accord. to the opinion which is generally preferred and which commonly obtains, the noun signifying the thing excepted is a substitute for the noun signifying that from which the exception is made; but it is allowable to put it in the accus. case according to the general rule respecting exception; so that one says, <foreign lang="ar">maA qaAma A^aHadN A_il~aA zayodN</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">A_il~aA zayodFA</foreign> [<hi>There stood not any one, except Zeyd</hi>]: and the same is the case in a prohibitive sentence; as in <foreign lang="ar">laA yaqumo A^aHadN</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">A_il~aA zayodN</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">A_il~aA zayodFA</foreign> [<hi>Let not any one stand, except Zeyd</hi>]; and in an interrogative sentence; as in <foreign lang="ar">halo qaAma A^aHadN A_il~aA zayodN</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">A_il~aA zayodFA</foreign> [<hi>Did any one stand, except Zeyd?</hi>]; when, in such sentences, the thing excepted is united in kind to that from which the exception is made.

You say also, <foreign lang="ar">maA jaA='aniY A_il~aA zayodN</foreign> [<hi>There came not to me</hi> any, <hi>save Zeyd</hi>], without mentioning that from which the exception is made; (TA;) and <foreign lang="ar">maA Darabotu A_il~aA zayodFA</foreign> [<hi>I beat not</hi> any, <hi>save Zeyd</hi>]; and <foreign lang="ar">maA mararotu A_il~aA bizayodK</foreign> [<hi>I passed not</hi> by any, <hi>save by Zeyd</hi>]; (I' Ak p. 164;) the case of the noun signifying the thing excepted being the same as if <foreign lang="ar">Al~A</foreign> were not mentioned: (I' Ak ubi suprà, and TA:*) but you may not say, affirmatively, <foreign lang="ar">Darabotu A_il~aA zayodFA</foreign>, or the like. (I 'Ak ubi suprà.) When the thing excepted precedes that from which the exception is made, if the sentence is affirmative, the noun signifying the former must be in the accus. case; as in <foreign lang="ar">qaAma A_il~aA zayodFA Alqawomu</foreign> [<hi>Except Zeyd, the people,</hi> or <hi>company of men, stood</hi>]: and so, accord. to the usage generally preferred, when the sentence is not affirmative; as in <foreign lang="ar">maAqaAma A_il~aA zayodFA Alqawomu</foreign> [<hi>Except Zeyd, the people,</hi> or <hi>company of men, stood not</hi>]; but recorded instances allow one's saying also, <foreign lang="ar">maA qaAma A_il~aA zayodN Alqawomu</foreign>. (I 'Ak p. 163.) When the thing excepted is disunited in kind from that from which the exception is made, if the sentence is affirmative, the noun signifying the former must likewise be in the accus. case; as in <foreign lang="ar">qaAma Alqawomu A_il~aA</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">HimaArFA</foreign> [<hi>The people,</hi> or <hi>company of men, stood, but</hi>

                  <foreign lang="ar">A_il~aA HimaArFA</foreign> means <hi>Beat not thou the people, but an ass;</hi> and] <foreign lang="ar">falawlaA kaAnato qaroyapN A=manato fanafaEahaA A_iymaAnuhaA A_il~aA</foreign>

(T.) When <foreign lang="ar">A_il~aA</foreign> is repeated for the purpose of corroboration, it has no effect upon what follows it, except that of corroborating the first exception; as in <foreign lang="ar">maA mararotu</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">biA^aHadK A_al~aA zayodK A_il~aA A^axiyka</foreign> [<hi>I passed not by any one, except Zeyd, except thy brother</hi>], in which <foreign lang="ar">Axyk</foreign> is a substitute for <foreign lang="ar">zyd</foreign>, for it is as though you said, <foreign lang="ar">maA mararotu biA^aHadK A_il~aA zayodK A^axiyka</foreign>; and as in <foreign lang="ar">qaAma Alqawomu</foreign>

When the repetition is not for that purpose, if the sentence is devoid of the mention of that from which the exception is made, you make the governing word [which is the verb] to affect one, whichever you please, of the nouns signifying the things excepted, and put the others in the accus. case, so that you say, <foreign lang="ar">maA qaAma A_il~aA zayodN A_il~aA EamorFA A_il~aA bakorFA</foreign> [<hi>There stood not</hi> any, <hi>save Zeyd, save' Amr, save Bekr</hi>]; but if the sentence is not devoid of the mention of that from which the exception is made, different rules are observed accord. as the things excepted are mentioned before that from which the exception is made or after it: in the former case, all must be put in the accus., whether the sentence be affirmative or not affirmative; as in <foreign lang="ar">qaAma A_il~aA zayodFA A_il~aA EamorFA A_il~aA bakorFA Alqawomu</foreign> [<hi>Except Zeyd, except' Amr, except Bekr, the people stood</hi>], and <foreign lang="ar">maAqaAma A_il~aA zayodFA A_il~aA EamorFA A_il~aA bakorFA Alqawomu</foreign> [<hi>Except Zeyd, except' Amr, except Bekr, the people stood not</hi>]: in the latter case, when the sentence is affirmative, all must likewise be put in the accus., so that you say, <foreign lang="ar">qaAma Alqawomu A_il~aA zayodFA A_il~aA EamorFA A_il~aA bakorFA</foreign> [<hi>The people stood, except Zeyd, except' Amr, except Bekr</hi>]; but when the sentence is not affirmative, the same rule is observed with respect to one of them as when the exception is not repeated, accord. to the usage generally preferred, or it may be put in the accus., which is rarely done, and the rest must be put in the accus., so that you say, <foreign lang="ar">maA qaAma A^aHadN A_il~aA</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">zayodN A_il~aA EamorFA A_il~aA bakorFA</foreign> [<hi>There stood not any one, except Zeyd, except' Amr, except Bekr,</hi> accord. to the more approved usage], <foreign lang="ar">zyd</foreign> being a substitute for <foreign lang="ar">AHd</foreign>, or you may make the other nouns which remain to be substitutes.

(T, Mughnee.

(T.) When it is used as a qualificative, it differs from <foreign lang="ar">gayoru</foreign> inasmuch as that the noun qualified by it may not be suppressed; so that one may not say, <foreign lang="ar">jaA='aniY A_il~aA zayodN</foreign> [meaning <hi>There came to me not Zeyd</hi>]; whereas one says, <foreign lang="ar">jaA=y^aniY gayoru zayodK</foreign>: and, accord. to some, in this also; that it may not be used as such unless it may be used to denote exception; so that one may say, <foreign lang="ar">EinodiY</foreign>

(Mughnee.) ―         -b3-  Thirdly, (Mughnee,) sometimes, (S, Msb,) it is used as a conjunction, (Mughnee, K,) in the manner of <foreign lang="ar">wa</foreign> (S, Mughnee, K,) consociating both literally and as to the meaning, as mentioned by Akh and Fr and AO, (Mughnee,) [i. e.] as <hi>syn. with</hi> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">wa</foreign> [<hi>And</hi>]. (Msb.) Thus in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">liy^alA~a yakuwna liln~aAsi Ealayokumo HujapN A_il~aA A@l~a*iyna ZalamuwA</foreign> [<hi>That there may not be to men, against you, any allegation, and</hi> (meaning <hi>nor</hi>) to <hi>those who have acted wrongfully</hi>]; (Msb, Mughnee, K;) occurring in the Kur [ii. 145]; (Msb;) so accord. to Akh and Fr and AO; (Mughnee;) i. e., and those who have acted wrongfully also, to them there shall not be, against you, any allegation: (Msb:) Fr explains it as meaning that the wrongdoer has no allegation of which account should be taken; and this is correct, and is the opinion held by Zj. (T.) Thus, too, in the saying [in the Kur xxvii. 10 and 11], <foreign lang="ar">laA yaxaAfu ladaY~a A@lomurosaluwna A_il~aA mano Zalama</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">vum~a badala HusonFA baEoda suw'K</foreign> [<hi>The apostles shall not fear in my presence, and</hi> neither shall <hi>he who hath acted wrongfully, then hath done good instead, after evil;</hi> as some explain it; but others say that <foreign lang="ar">walaA mano Zalama</foreign> here denotes exception]. (Mughnee, in which it is explained as meaning ; and K.) And thus in the saying of the poet, [namely, El-Mukhabbal Es-Saadee, (S in art. <foreign lang="ar">xld</foreign>,)] <pb n="78"/>

[Often in post-classical works, and perhaps in classical also, but seldom except when it is preceded by a condition with its complement, the verb or verbal proposition which should immediately follow it is suppressed; as in the like of the saying, <foreign lang="ar">A_ino faEalota ka*aA Eafawotu</foreign>

(TA.) The <foreign lang="ar">Al</foreign> is pronounced with the disjunctive hemzeh in using the vocative form of address [<foreign lang="ar">yaA Aall~`hu</foreign>] because it is inseparably prefixed as an honourable distinction of this name; (S;) or because a pause upon the vocative particle is intended in honour of the name; (S in art. <foreign lang="ar">lyh</foreign>;) and AAF says that it is also thus pronounced in a form of swearing; as in <foreign lang="ar">A^afaAall~`hi latafoEalan~a</foreign> [an elliptical phrase, as will be shown below, meaning <hi>Then, by God, wilt thou indeed do</hi> such a thing?]; though he denies its being thus pronounced because it is inseparable; regarding it as a substitute for the suppressed hemzeh of <foreign lang="ar">AlA_ilaAhu</foreign>: (S in the present art.:) Sb mentions this pronunciation in <foreign lang="ar">yaA Aall~`hu</foreign>; and Th mentions the pronunciation of <foreign lang="ar">yaA All~`hu</foreign> also, with the conjunctive hemzeh: Ks, moreover, mentions, as used by the Arabs, the phrase <foreign lang="ar">yalaho AagofiroliY</foreign> [<hi>O God, forgive me</hi>], for <foreign lang="ar">yaA All~`hu</foreign>; but this is disapproved. (ISd, TA.) The word is pronounced in the manner termed <foreign lang="ar">tafoxiym</foreign>, [i. e., with the broad sound of the lengthened fet-h, and with a full sound of the letter <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign>,] for the purpose of showing honour to it; but when it is preceded by a kesreh, [as in <foreign lang="ar">biAll~`hi</foreign>

(Lth, T.) Thus you say, <foreign lang="ar">A^azayudN fiY Ald~aAri A^amo EamorNw</foreign> [<hi>Is Zeyd in the house, or 'Amr?</hi>]; (S, Mughnee;) i. e. which of them two (<foreign lang="ar">A^ay~uhumaA</foreign>) is in the house? (S;) therefore what follows <foreign lang="ar">Am</foreign> and what precedes it compose one sentence; and it is not used in commanding nor in forbidding; and what follows it must correspond to what precedes it in the quality of noun and of verb; so that you say, <foreign lang="ar">A^azayodN qaAy^imN A^amE qaAEidN</foreign> [<hi>Is Zeyd standing, or sitting?</hi>] and <foreign lang="ar">A^aqaAma zayodN A^amo</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">qaEada</foreign> [<hi>Did Zeyd stand, or sit?</hi>]. (Msb.)

(S.) ―         -b2-  As connected in like manner with what goes before, it is preceded by <foreign lang="ar">A^a</foreign> denoting equality [by occurring after <foreign lang="ar">sawaA='N</foreign> &amp;c.], and corresponds thereto, as in [the Kur lxiii. 6,] <foreign lang="ar">sawaA='u Ealayohimo A^asotagofarota lahumN lamN tasotagufiro lahumN</foreign> [It will be <hi>equal to them whether thou beg forgiveness for them or do not beg forgiveness for them</hi>]. (Mughnee.) ―         -b3-  It is also unconnected with what precedes it, (S, Msb, Mughnee,) implying always digression, (Mughnee,) preceded by an enunciative, or an interrogative, (S, Msb, Mughnee,) other than <foreign lang="ar">A^a</foreign>, (Mughnee,) or by <foreign lang="ar">A^a</foreign> not meant [really] as an interrogative but to denote disapproval, (Mughnee,) and signifies <foreign lang="ar">balo</foreign>, (Lth, Zj, T, S, M, Mughnee, K,) or <foreign lang="ar">balo</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">A^a</foreign> together, (Msb,) and this is its meaning always accord. to all the Basrees, but the Koofees deny this. (Mughnee.) Thus, using it after an enunciative, you say, <foreign lang="ar">A_in~ahaA laA_ibilN A^amo $aA='N</foreign> [<hi>Verily they are camels: nay,</hi> or <hi>nay but, they are sheep,</hi> or <hi>goats:</hi> or <hi>nay, are they sheep,</hi> or <hi>goats?</hi>]: (S Msb, Mughnee:) this being said when one looks at a bodily form, and imagines it to be a number of camels, and says what first occurs to him; then the opinion that it is a number of sheep or goats suggests itself to him, and he turns from the first idea, and says, <foreign lang="ar">A^amo $aA='N</foreign>, meaning <foreign lang="ar">balo</foreign>, because it is a digression from what precedes it; though what follows <foreign lang="ar">bl</foreign> is [properly] a thing known certainly, and what follows <foreign lang="ar">Am</foreign> is opined. (S, TA.) And using it after an interrogative in this case, you say, <foreign lang="ar">halo zyodN</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">munoTaliqN A^amo EamorNw</foreign> [<hi>Is Zeyd going away? Nay rather,</hi> or, <hi>or rather, is 'Amr?</hi>]: you digress from the question respecting Zeyd's going away, and make the question to relate to 'Amr; so that <foreign lang="ar">Am</foreign> implies indecisive opinion, and interrogation, and digression. (S.) And thus using it, you say, <foreign lang="ar">halo zayodN</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">qaAma A^amo EamorNw</foreign> [<hi>Did Zeyd stand? Nay rather,</hi> or <hi>or rather, did 'Amr?</hi>]. (Msb.)

                  <foreign lang="ar">waAln~uwru</foreign> [<hi>Are the blind and the seeing equal? Or rather are darkness and light equal?</hi>]. (Mughnee.) And an ex. of it preceded by <foreign lang="ar">A^a</foreign> used to denote disapproval is the saying [in the Kur vii. 194], <foreign lang="ar">A^alahumo A^arojulN yamo$uwna bihaA A^amo lahumo A^ayodK yaboTi$uwna bihaA</foreign> [<hi>Have they feet, to walk therewith? Or have they hands to assault therewith?</hi>]: for <foreign lang="ar">A^a</foreign> is here equivalent to a negation. (Mughnee.) [It has been shown above that] <foreign lang="ar">A^amo</foreign> is sometimes introduced immediately before <foreign lang="ar">halo</foreign>: (S, K:) but IB says that this is when <foreign lang="ar">hl</foreign> occurs in a phrase next before it; [as in the ex. from the Kur xiii. 17, cited above;] and in this case, the interrogative meaning of <foreign lang="ar">Am</foreign> is annulled; it being introduced only to denote a digression. (TA.) ―         -b4-  It is also used as a simple interrogative; accord. to the assertion of AO; in <pb n="89"/> the sense of <foreign lang="ar">halo</foreign>; (Mughnee;) or in the sense of the interrogative <foreign lang="ar">A^a</foreign>; (Lth, T, K) as in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">A^amo Einodaka gadaA='i HaADirN</foreign>, meaning <hi>Hast thou a morning-meal ready?</hi> a good form of speech used by the Arabs; (Lth, T;) and allowable when preceded by another phrase.

(TA in that art.) [But IHsh states the case differently; saying,] An instance of <foreign lang="ar">A^am~aA A^anota munTaliqFA AnoTalaqotu</foreign> not used to restrain from governing, but as a substitute for a verb, occurs in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">A^am~aA A^anota munTaliqFA AinoTalaqotu</foreign> [<hi>Because thou wast going away, I went away</hi>]; originally, <foreign lang="ar">AinoTalaqotu liA^ano kunota munTaliqAF</foreign>: [for an explanation of which, see what is said of <foreign lang="ar">A^am~aA A^anota</foreign> in a reading of the verse commencing with <foreign lang="ar">A^abaA xuraA$ap</foreign> voce <foreign lang="ar">A^am~aA</foreign>:] but accord. to El-Fárisee and IJ, the government belongs to <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign>; not to <foreign lang="ar">kaAna</foreign> [or <foreign lang="ar">kunota</foreign>]. (Mughnee in art. <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign>.) ―         -b3-  So too in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">AifoEalo h*aA</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">A_im~aAlaA</foreign>, meaning <foreign lang="ar">A_ino kunota laAtafoEalu gayorahu</foreign> [i. e. <hi>Do thou this if thou wilt not do another thing;</hi> or <hi>do thou this at least</hi>]; (Mughnee and K, each in art. <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign>;) indicating a person's refusal to do [fully] that which he is ordered to do: (TA in that art.:) or <foreign lang="ar">A_im~aAlaA faAfoEalo ka*aA</foreign>, meaning <hi>if thou wilt not do that, then do thou this;</hi> the three particles [<foreign lang="ar">A_ino</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">laA</foreign>] being made as one word: so says Lth: (T:) [J says,] <foreign lang="ar">A_im~aAlaA faAfoEalo ka*aA</foreign> is pronounced with imáleh, [i. e. “ immá-lè, ”] and is originally <foreign lang="ar">A_in laA</foreign> with <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign> as a connective; and the meaning is, <hi>if that thing will not be, then do thou thus:</hi> (S in art. <foreign lang="ar">laA</foreign>:) [but] AHát [disallows this pronunciation, and] says, sometimes the vulgar, in the place of <foreign lang="ar">AifoEalo *`lika A_im~aAlaA</foreign>, say, <foreign lang="ar">AifoEalo *`lika baAriY</foreign> [<hi>Do thou that at least</hi>]; but this is Persian, and is rejected as wrong: and they say also, <foreign lang="ar">A^um~aAlaYo</foreign>, with damm to the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> [and with imáleh in the case of the final vowel, and thus it is vulgarly pronounced in the present day]; but this too is wrong; for it is correctly <foreign lang="ar">A_im~aAlaA</foreign>, [with kesr, and] not pronounced with imáleh, for particles [in general] are not thus pronounced: (T:) and the vulgar also convert the hemzeh into <foreign lang="ar">h</foreign> with damm [saying <foreign lang="ar">hum~aAlaYo</foreign>]. (TA in art. <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign>.) [Fei says,] <foreign lang="ar">laA</foreign> is a substitute for the verb in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">A_im~aAlaA faAfoEalo h`*aA</foreign>, the meaning being <hi>If thou do not that, then</hi> [<hi>at least</hi>] <hi>do thou this:</hi> the origin thereof is this; that certain things are incumbent on a man to do, and he is required to do them, but refuses; and then one is content with his doing some, or a part, of them, and says to him thus: i. e., <hi>if thou wilt not do all, then do thou this:</hi> then the verb is suppressed, on account of the frequency of the usage of the phrase, and <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign> is added to give force to the meaning: and some say that it is for this reason that <foreign lang="ar">laA</foreign> is here pronounced with imáleh; because it serves for the verb; like as <foreign lang="ar">balaY</foreign> is, and the vocative <foreign lang="ar">yaA</foreign>: but it is said that it is correctly pronounced without imáleh; because particles [in general] are not pronounced therewith; as Az says. (Msb in art. <foreign lang="ar">laA</foreign>.) [El-Hareeree says that] <foreign lang="ar">A_im~aAlaA</foreign> is properly [a compound of] three particles, which are <foreign lang="ar">A_ino</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">laA</foreign>, made as one word, and the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> at the end thereof is like the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> of <foreign lang="ar">HubaAraY</foreign> [in which it is written <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign>, agreeably with rule]; wherefore it is pronounced with imáleh, like as is the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> of this latter word. (Durrat el-Ghowwás, in De Sacy's Anthol. Gr. Ar. p. 57 of the Arabic text.) In the Lubáb it is said that <foreign lang="ar">laA</foreign> is used as a negative of the future, as in <foreign lang="ar">lA tafoEalo</foreign>; and the verb [in <foreign lang="ar">A_im~aAlaA</foreign>] is suppressed; so it [<foreign lang="ar">lA</foreign>] serves as a substitute in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">AifoEalo h`*aA A_im~aAlaA</foreign>; therefore they pronounce its <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> with imáleh: and IAth says that the Arabs sometimes pronounced <foreign lang="ar">laA</foreign> with a slight imáleh; and the vulgar make the imáleh thereof full, so that its <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> becomes <foreign lang="ar">Y</foreign>; but this is wrong. (TA.) You say also, <foreign lang="ar">xu*o h`*aA A_im~aAlaA</foreign>, meaning <hi>Take thou this if thou take not that.</hi> (T.) It is related that the Prophet saw a runaway camel, and said, “ To whom belongeth this camel? ” when, lo, some young men of the Ansár said, “ We have drawn water upon him during twenty years, and yet he has in him fat; so we desired to slaughter him; but he escaped from us. ” He said, “ Will ye sell him? ” They answered, “ No: but he is thine. ” And he said, <foreign lang="ar">A_im~aAlaA fA^aHosinuwA A_ilayohi</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">Hat~aY yA^otiyahu A^ajaluhu</foreign>, meaning <hi>If ye will not sell him, act well to him until his term of life come to him.</hi> (T.)   </entryFree>

(Marginal note in a copy of the Mughnee.) [Accord. to Az,] it is best to say ↓ 
      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^anaA</orth> in a case of pause; and ↓ 
      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^ana</orth> in a case of conjunction with a following word, as in <foreign lang="ar">A^ana faEalotu</foreign>

      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A=na</orth>. (T.) [Accord. to J,] ↓ 
      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^anaA</orth> is a pronoun denoting the speaker alone, and is made to end invariably with fet-h to distinguish it from the particle <foreign lang="ar">A^ano</foreign> which renders the aor. mansoob; the final <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> being for the purpose of showing what is the vowel in a case of pause; but when it occurs in the middle [or beginning] of a sentence, it is dropped, except in a bad dialect. (S.) [Accord. to ISd,] ↓ 
      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^ana</orth> is a noun denoting the speaker; and in a case of pause, you add <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> at the end, [saying ↓ 
      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^anaA</orth>,] to denote quiescence; (M;) [or] it is better to do this, though it is not always done: (TA:) but it is said, on the authority of Ktr, that there are five dial. vars. of this word; namely, <foreign lang="ar">faEalotu</foreign> ↓ 
      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^ana</orth>, and ↓ 
      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^anaA</orth>, and ↓

      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^anahN</orth>, all mentioned by IJ; but there is some weakness in this: IJ says that the <foreign lang="ar">h</foreign> in ↓ 
      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^anahN</orth> may be a substitute for the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> in <foreign lang="ar">A^anaA</foreign>, because the latter is the more usual, and the former is rare; or it may be added to show what is the vowel, like the <foreign lang="ar">h</foreign>, and be like the <foreign lang="ar">h</foreign> in <foreign lang="ar">kitaAbiyaho</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">HisaAbiyahN</foreign>. (M.) For the dual, as well as the pl., only <foreign lang="ar">naHonu</foreign> is used. (Az, TA.) ―         -b2-  It is also a pronoun denoting the person addressed, or spoken to, by assuming the form ↓ 
      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^anota</orth> [<hi>Thou,</hi> masc.]; <foreign lang="ar">t</foreign> being added to it as the sign of the person addressed, (S, M, Mughnee, K,) and <foreign lang="ar">A^ano</foreign> being the pronoun, (M, Mughnee, K,) accord. to the general opinion; (Mughnee, K;) the two becoming as one; not that one is prefixed to the other as governing it in the gen. case: (S:) and so ↓ 
      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^anoti</orth>, (S, M, Mughnee, K,) addressed to the female: (S, M:) and ↓ 
      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^anotumaA</orth>, (M, Mughnee, K,) addressed to two; not a regular dual, for were it so it would be <foreign lang="ar">A^anotaAn</foreign>; but like <foreign lang="ar">kumaA</foreign> in <foreign lang="ar">DarabotukumaA</foreign>: (M:) and ↓ 
      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^anotumN</orth> and ↓ 
      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^anotun~a</orth>, (S, Mughnee, K,) which are [respectively] the masc. and fem. pls. (TA.) ―         -b3-  To each of these the <foreign lang="ar">k</foreign> of comparison is sometimes prefixed; so that you say, ↓ 
      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^anota kaA^anaA</orth> [<hi>Thou art like me,</hi> or <hi>as I</hi>], and ↓ 
      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^anaA kaA^anota</orth> [or <foreign lang="ar">A^ana kaA^anota</foreign> 
                  <hi>I am like thee,</hi> or <hi>as thou</hi>]; as is related on the authority of the Arabs; for though the <foreign lang="ar">k</foreign> of comparison is not prefixed to the [affixed] pronoun, and you say, <foreign lang="ar">A^anota kazayodK</foreign> but not <foreign lang="ar">A^anota kiy</foreign>, yet the separate pronoun is regarded by them as being in the same predicament as the noun; and therefore the prefixing it to the latter kind of pronoun is approved. (S.) It is said in the Book of <foreign lang="ar">layosa</foreign>, by IKh, that there is no such phrase, in the language of the Arabs, as <foreign lang="ar">A^anota kiY</foreign>, nor as <foreign lang="ar">A^anaA kaka</foreign>, except in two forged verses; wherefore Sb says that the Arabs, by saying <foreign lang="ar">A^anota mivoliY</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">A^anaA mvoluka</foreign>, have no need of saying <foreign lang="ar">A^anota kiY</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">A^anaA kaka</foreign>: and the two verses are these: <quote>

(S.) It occurs in two places: first, in that of the inchoative, or in the beginning of a phrase, so that it is in the place of a nom. case; as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 180], <foreign lang="ar">waA^ano taSuwmuwA xayorN lakumo</foreign> [<hi>And that ye fast is better for you</hi>]; (Mughnee, K;) i. e. <foreign lang="ar">SiyaAmukumo</foreign> [<hi>your fasting</hi>]. (TA.) And, secondly, after a word denoting a meaning which is not that of certainty: and thus it is the place of a nom. case; as in the saying [in the Kur lvii. 15], <foreign lang="ar">A^alamo yaA^ani lil~a*iyna A=manuwA A^anN taxo$aEa quluwbuhumo</foreign> [<hi>Hath not the time that their hearts should become submissive,</hi> i. e. <hi>the time of their hearts' becoming submissive, yet come unto those who have believed?</hi>]: and in the place of an accus. case; as in the saying [in the Kur x. 38], <foreign lang="ar">wamaA kaAna h*aA</foreign>

(M.) When it is suppressed, the aor. may be either mansoob or marfooa; but the latter is the better; as in the saying in the Kur [xxxix. 64], <foreign lang="ar">A^afagayora All~`hi taA^omuruwn~iY A^aEobudu</foreign> [<hi>Other than God do ye bid me worship?</hi>]. (S.) If it occurs immediately before a preterite, it combines with it to form an equivalent to an inf. n. relating to past time; being in this case without government: you say, <foreign lang="ar">A^aEojayaniyA^ano qumota</foreign> [<hi>It pleased me that thou stoodest</hi>]; meaning <hi>thy standing that is past pleased me:</hi> (S:) and thus it is used in the saying [in the Kur xxviii. 82], <foreign lang="ar">lawolaA A^anN man~a All~`hu EalayonaA</foreign> [<hi>Were it not for that God conferred favour upon us;</hi> i. e., <hi>for God's having conferred favour upon us</hi>]. (Mughnee.) It is also conjoined with an imperative; as in the phrase mentioned by Sb, <foreign lang="ar">katabotu A_ilayhi biA^anp qumN</foreign> [<hi>I wrote to him, Stand;</hi> i. e. <hi>I wrote to him the command to stand</hi>]; which shows that AHei is wrong in asserting that whenever it is conjoined with an imperative it is an explicative [in the sense of <foreign lang="ar">A^ayN</foreign>], and that in this particular instance the <foreign lang="ar">b</foreign> may be redundant, which it cannot here be, because, whether redundant or not, it is not put immediately before anything but a noun or what may be rendered by a noun. (Mughnee.) ―         -b2-  Secondly, it is a con- <pb n="105"/> traction of <foreign lang="ar">A^an~a</foreign>; (Mughnee, K;) and occurs after a verb denoting certainty, or one used in a manner similar to that of such a verb: (Mughnee:) so in the saying [in the Kur lxxiii. 20], <foreign lang="ar">Ealima A^anN sayakuwnu</foreign>

                  <foreign lang="ar">Alojan~apu</foreign> [<hi>And it shall be proclaimed to them, being said, That is Paradise</hi>]; or in these two instances it may be regarded as what is termed <foreign lang="ar">maSodariy~ap</foreign>, by supposing the preposition [<foreign lang="ar">bi</foreign>] understood before it, so that in the former instance it is the biliteral, because it is put before the imperative, and in the second it is the contraction of <foreign lang="ar">A^an~a</foreign> because it is put before a nominal proposition; (Mughnee;) and [in the Kur xxxviii. 5,] <foreign lang="ar">waAnoTalaqa</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">AlomalaA^u minohumo A^ani Amo$uwA</foreign>(S, M, Mughnee) i. e. [<hi>And the chief persons of them</hi>] broke forth, or launched forth, with their tongues, or in speech, [saying,] Go ye on, or continue ye, in your course of action &amp;c. (Mughnee.) For this usage of <foreign lang="ar">A^ano</foreign> certain conditions are requisite : first, that it be preceded by a proposition : secondly, that it be followed by a proposition; so that you may not say, <foreign lang="ar">*akarotu</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">EasojadFA A^ano *ahabFA</foreign>, but you must say <foreign lang="ar">A^aYN</foreign> in this case, or must omit the explicative : thirdly, that the preceding proposition convey the meaning of <foreign lang="ar">Alqawolu</foreign>, as in the exs. above; in the last of which, <foreign lang="ar">AnTlq</foreign> has the meaning assigned to it above; not that of walking or going away : fourthly, that there be not in the preceding proposition the letters of <foreign lang="ar">Alqawolu</foreign>; so that one may not say, <foreign lang="ar">qulotu lahu A^ani AfoEalo</foreign>; or, if there be in it those letters, that the word which they compose shall be interpreted by another word; as in the saying, in the Kur [v, 117], <foreign lang="ar">maA qulotu lahumo A_il~aA maA A^amarotaniY bihi A^ani AEobuduwA All~`ha</foreign> which may mean, as Z says, <hi> I have not commanded them</hi> [aught <hi>save that which Thou commandedst me, saying, Worship ye God</hi>]; (Mughnee;) in which instance Fr says that it is an explicative : (T :) fifthly, that there be not a preposition immediately before it; for if you say, <foreign lang="ar">katabotu A_ilayohi biA^ani AfoEalo ka*aA</foreign>, it is what is termed <foreign lang="ar">maSodariy~ap</foreign> [as we have before shown]. (Mughnee.) When it may be regarded as an explicative and is followed by an aor. with <foreign lang="ar">lA</foreign> as in <foreign lang="ar">A^a$arotu A_ilayohi A^ano</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">laA tafoEal ka*aA</foreign>, it may be marfooa, [namely, the aor.,] on the supposition that <foreign lang="ar">lA</foreign> is a negative ; or mejzoom, on the supposition that it is a prohibitive; and in both cases <foreign lang="ar">An</foreign> is an explicative ; [so that the meaning is, <hi>I made a sign to him,</hi> as though <hi>saying, Thou wilt not do such a thing,</hi> in the former case ; or, in the latter, <hi>Do not thou such a thing ;</hi>] or mansoob, on the supposition that <foreign lang="ar">lA</foreign> is a negative and that <foreign lang="ar">An</foreign> is what is termed <foreign lang="ar">maSodariy~ap</foreign>: but if <foreign lang="ar">lA</foreign> is wanting, it may not be mejzoom, but may be marfooa [if we use <foreign lang="ar">An</foreign> as an explicative] or mansoob [if <foreign lang="ar">An</foreign> be what is termed <foreign lang="ar">maSodariy~ap</foreign>]. (Mughnee.)―         -b3-  Fourthly, it is redundant, as a corroborative, (Mughnee, K,) like whatever else is redundant : and thus it is in four cases : one of these, which is the most common, being when it occurs after <foreign lang="ar">lam~aA</foreign> denoting time; [and this is mentioned in the M ; ] as in the saying [in the Kur xxix. 32], <foreign lang="ar">walm~aA A^ano jaA='a to</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">rusulunaA luwTFA</foreign> [<hi>And when our apostles came to Lot</hi>]: (Mughnee:) [or,] accord. to J, (TA,) it is sometimes a connective to <foreign lang="ar">lam~aA</foreign>; as in the saying in the Kur [xii. 96], <foreign lang="ar">falam~aA A^ano jaA='a Aloba$iyru</foreign> [<hi>And when that</hi> (like as we say, " now that,") <hi>the announcer of good tidings came</hi>] : and sometimes it is redundant ; as in the saying in the Kur [viii. 34], <foreign lang="ar">wamaA lahumo A^ano laA yuEa*ibahumu All~`hu</foreign> [as though it might be rendered <hi>But what reason have they, God should not punish them?</hi>] : (S, TA:) but IB says that the connective is redundant ; and [that <foreign lang="ar">An</foreign> is not redundant in the latter instance, for] if it were redundant in this verse of the Kur it would not render the [aor.] verb mansoob. (TA. [The author of the Mughnee, like IB, disallows that <foreign lang="ar">An</foreign> is redundant in a case of this kind, which Kh asserts it to be ; and says that <foreign lang="ar">fiY</foreign> is under- <pb n="106"/> stood before it.]) The second case is when it occurs between <foreign lang="ar">lawN</foreign> and a verb signifying swearing, the latter being expressed; as in this verse: <quote>

(Mughnee.) The third case, which is extr., is when it occurs between the <foreign lang="ar">k</foreign> [of comparison] and the noun governed by it in the genitive case; as in the saying, <quote>

(Mughnee.) ―         -b4-  [Fifthly,] among other meanings which have been assigned to it, (Mughnee,) it has a conditional meaning, like <foreign lang="ar">A_inN</foreign>: (Mughnee, K:) so the Koofees hold; and it seems to be most probably correct, for several reasons: first, because both these forms occur, accord. to different readings, in several instances, in one passage of the Kur; as in [ii. 282,] <foreign lang="ar">A^ano taDil~N</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">A_iHodaAhumaA</foreign> [<hi>If one of them twain</hi> (namely, women,) <hi>err</hi>]; &amp;c.: secondly, because [the prefix] <foreign lang="ar">fa</foreign> often occurs after it; as in a verse commencing with <foreign lang="ar">A^abaA xuraA$apa</foreign> [as cited voce <foreign lang="ar">A^am~aA</foreign>, accord. to some who hold that <foreign lang="ar">A^m~aA</foreign> in that verse is a compound of the conditional <foreign lang="ar">A^ano</foreign> and the redundant <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign>; and as in the Kur ii. 282, where the words quoted above are immediately followed by <foreign lang="ar">fatu*ak~ira A_iHodaAhumaA</foreign>

                  <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign>; (S;) and is put before a nominal proposition; (Mughnee, K;) as in the saying [in the Kur lxvii. 20], <foreign lang="ar">A_ini A@lokaAfiruwna</foreign>

(Mughnee.) When it is put before a nominal proposition, it has no government, accord. to Sb and Fr; but Ks and Mbr allow its governing in the manner of <foreign lang="ar">layosa</foreign>; and Sa'eed Ibn-Jubeyr reads, [in the Kur vii. 193,] <foreign lang="ar">A_ini A@l~a*iyna</foreign>

      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A_in~a</orth> may be explained as originally <foreign lang="ar">A_inN A^anaA qaAy^imN</foreign> [<hi>I am not standing</hi>]; the <foreign lang="ar">A^</foreign> of <foreign lang="ar">A^anaA</foreign> being elided for no reason in itself, and the <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign> of <foreign lang="ar">A_inN</foreign> being incorporated into the <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign> of <foreign lang="ar">A^anaA</foreign>, and the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign> of this latter being elided in its conjunction with the following word; but <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a qaAy^imFA</foreign> has also been heard. (Mughnee.) Sometimes it occurs [as a negative] in the complement of an oath: you say, <foreign lang="ar">waA@ll~`hi A_inN faEalotu</foreign>, meaning <foreign lang="ar">maA faEalotu</foreign> [<hi>By God, I did not</hi>]. (S.) ―         -b3-  [Thirdly,] it is a contraction of <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a</foreign>, and is put before a nominal and before a verbal proposition. (Mughnee, K.) In the former case, it is made to govern and is made to have no government: (S, * K:) [i. e.] in this case, it is allowable to make it govern; contr. to the opinion of the Koofees: (Mughnee:) Lth says that he who uses the contracted form of <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a</foreign> uses the nom. case with it, except that some of the people of El-Hijáz use the accus. case with it: (T:) thus it is said, accord. to one reading, [in the Kur xi. 113,] <foreign lang="ar">A_ino kul~aA lamaA</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">layuwaf~iyan~ahumN rab~uka A^aEomaAlahumN</foreign> [<hi>Verily all</hi> of them, <hi>thy Lord will indeed fully render them</hi> the recompense of <hi>their works</hi>]: (T, Mughnee:) Fr says, We have not heard the Arabs use the contracted form and make it to govern, unless with a pronoun, in which case the desinential syntax is not apparent; and he adds that in the instance cited above, they make <foreign lang="ar">kul~A</foreign> to be governed in the accus. case by <foreign lang="ar">lywf~yn~hm</foreign>; as though the phrase were <foreign lang="ar">layuwaf~iyan~ahumo</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">kul~aA</foreign>; and that <foreign lang="ar">kul~u</foreign> would be proper; for you say, <foreign lang="ar">A_ino zayodN laqaAy^imN</foreign> [<hi>Verily Zeyd is standing</hi>]: (T:) the ex. given by Sb is, <foreign lang="ar">A_ino EamorFA lamunTaliqN</foreign> [<hi>Verily 'Amr is going away</hi>]. (Mughnee.) But it is [most] frequently made to have no government; as in the saying [in the Kur xliii. 34 accord. to one reading], <foreign lang="ar">waA_ino kul~u *`lika lamaA mataAEu</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">A@loHayaApi A@ld~unoyaA</foreign> [<hi>And verily all that is the furniture of the present life</hi>]; and, accord. to the reading of Hafs, [and of 'Ásim and Kh, in the Kur xx. 66, respecting which see <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a</foreign>,] <foreign lang="ar">A_ino h`*aAni lasaAHiraAni</foreign> [<hi>Verily these two are enchanters</hi>]; &amp;c. (Mughnee.) When it is put before a verbal proposition, it is necessarily made to have no government: (Mughnee, K:) and in most cases the verb is a preterite and of the kind called <foreign lang="ar">naAsix</foreign> [which effects a change of the grammatical form or of the meaning in a nominal proposition before which it is placed]; as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 138], <foreign lang="ar">waA_ino kaAnatN lakabiyrapF</foreign> [<hi>And verily it was a great matter</hi>]; and [in the Kur xvii. 75,] <foreign lang="ar">waA_ino kaAduwA</foreign>

AZ says, it means <foreign lang="ar">laqado</foreign>, i. e. <hi>without doubt;</hi> and so in the same ch. vv. 78 and 108: (T:) less frequently it is an aor. of a verb of this kind; as in the saying [in the Kur xxvi. 186], <foreign lang="ar">waA_ino naZun~uka lamina A@lokaA*ibyna</foreign> [<hi>And verily we think thee to be of the number of the liars</hi>]: and both these kinds of expression may be taken as exs. to be imitated: less frequently than this it is a preterite of a verb not of the kind termed <foreign lang="ar">nasx</foreign>; as in the saying [of a poet], <quote>

Wherever you find <foreign lang="ar">A_inN</foreign> with <foreign lang="ar">la</foreign> after it, decide that it is originally <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a</foreign>; (Mughnee, K;) as in the exs. above: but respecting this <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign> there is a difference of opinion: see this letter. (Mughnee.) J says, (TA,) <foreign lang="ar">A_inN</foreign> is sometimes a contraction of <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a</foreign>, and this must have <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign> put before its predicate, to compensate for what is elided, of the doubled letter; as in the saying in the Kur [lxxxvi. 4, accord. to him who reads <foreign lang="ar">lamaA</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="ar">lam~aA</foreign>], <foreign lang="ar">A_ino kul~u nafosK lamaA EalayohaA HaAfiZN</foreign> [<hi>Verily every soul hath over it a guardian</hi>]; and in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">A_inN zaydN laA^axuwka</foreign> [<hi>Verily Zeyd is thy brother</hi>]; in order that it may not be confounded with <foreign lang="ar">A_inN</foreign> which is syn. with the negative <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign>: (S, TA:) but IB says, <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign> is here introduced to distinguish between negation and affirmation, and this <foreign lang="ar">A_ino</foreign> has neither subject nor predicate; so J's saying that the <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign> is put before its predicate is without meaning: and this <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign> is sometimes introduced with the objective complement of a verb; as in <foreign lang="ar">A_ino Darabotu</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">lazayodFA</foreign> [<hi>Verily I struck,</hi> or <hi>beat, Zeyd</hi>]; and with the agent; as in <foreign lang="ar">A_ino qaAma lazayodN</foreign> [<hi>Verily Zeyd stood</hi>]. (TA.) When the contracted <foreign lang="ar">A_ino</foreign> governs, this <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign> is not necessary; so you may say, <foreign lang="ar">A_ino zayodFA qaAy^imN</foreign> [<hi>Verily Zeyd is standing</hi>]; because in this case it cannot be confounded with the negative; for the negative does not render the subject mansoob and the predicate marfooa: and when it does not govern, if the meaning is apparent, the <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign> is not needed; as in <quote>

(Mughnee.) If the predicate is derived, the inf. n. by means of which it is explained is of the same radical letters; so that the implied meaning of <foreign lang="ar">balaganiy A^an~aka tanoTaliqu</foreign> [<hi>It has come to my knowledge,</hi> or <hi>been related to me,</hi> or <hi>been told to me,</hi> or <hi>it came to my knowledge,</hi> &amp;c., <hi>that thou goest away</hi>], or <foreign lang="ar">A^an~aka munoTaliqN</foreign> [<hi>that thou art going away</hi>], is <foreign lang="ar">balaganiy AlAinoTilaAqu</foreign> [or rather <foreign lang="ar">A@noTilaAquka</foreign> 
                  <hi>thy going away has come to my knowledge,</hi> &amp;c.]; and hence, the implied meaning of <foreign lang="ar">balaganiY A^an~aka fiy</foreign>

                  <foreign lang="ar">kaAy^inN zayodFA</foreign>; both signifying the same. (Mughnee.) There are cases in which either <foreign lang="ar">A^an~a</foreign> or <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a</foreign> may be used: [see the latter, in twelve places:] other cases in which only the former may be used: and others in which only the latter. (I 'Ak p. 91.) The former only may be used when the implied meaning is to be explained by an inf. n. (I 'Ak, K.) Such is the case when it occurs in the place of a noun governed by a verb in the nom. case; as in <foreign lang="ar">yuEojibuniY A^an~aka qaAy^imN</foreign> [<hi>It pleases me that thou art standing</hi>], i. e. <foreign lang="ar">qiyaAmuka</foreign> [<hi>thy standing</hi> pleases me]: or in the place of a noun governed by a verb in the accus. case; as in <foreign lang="ar">Earafotu A^at~aka qaAy^imN</foreign> [<hi>I knew that thou wast standing</hi>], i. e. <foreign lang="ar">qiyaAmaka</foreign> [<hi>thy standing</hi>]: or in the place of a noun governed in the gen. case by a particle; as in <foreign lang="ar">Eajibotu mino A^an~aka qaAy^imN</foreign> [<hi>I wondered that thou wast standing</hi>], i. e. <foreign lang="ar">mino qiyaAmka</foreign> [<hi>at,</hi> or <hi>by reason of, thy standing</hi>]: (I 'Ak p. 91:) [and sometimes a preposition is understood; as in <foreign lang="ar">laA $ak~a A^an~ahu ka*aA</foreign>, for <foreign lang="ar">laA $ak~a fiY A^an~ahu ka*aA</foreign>

(K.) Sometimes its <foreign lang="ar">A^</foreign> is changed into <foreign lang="ar">E</foreign>; so that you say, <foreign lang="ar">Ealimotu Ean~aka munoTaliqN</foreign> [meaning <hi>I knew that thou wast going away</hi>]. (M.) ―         -b2-  With <foreign lang="ar">k</foreign> prefixed to it, it is a particle of comparison, (S, * M, TA,) [still] governing the subject in the accus. case and the predicate in the nom. case: (TA:) you say, <foreign lang="ar">kaA^an~a zayodFA EamorNw</foreign> [It is <hi>as though Zeyd were 'Amr</hi>], meaning that Zeyd is like 'Amr; as though you said, <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a zayodFA kaAy^inN kaEamorKw</foreign> [<hi>verily, Zeyd is like 'Amr</hi>]: [it is to be accounted for by an ellipsis: or] the <foreign lang="ar">k</foreign> is taken away from the middle of this proposition, and put at its commencement, and then the kesreh of <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a</foreign> necessarily becomes changed to a fet-hah, because <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a</foreign> cannot be preceded by a preposition, for it never occurs but at the commencement [of a proposition]. (IJ, M.) Sometimes, <foreign lang="ar">kaA^an~a</foreign> denotes denial; as in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">kaA^an~aka A^amiyrunaA fataA^omuranaA</foreign> [<hi>As though thou wert our commander so that thou shouldst command us</hi>], meaning <hi>thou art not our commander</hi> [<hi>that thou shouldst command us</hi>].

      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^an~a</orth> is used in this case. (TA.)

(Msb.) <foreign lang="ar">A_in~amaA</foreign> is to be distinguished from <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a</foreign> with the conjunct [noun] <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign>, which does not restrain it from governing [though its government with this is not apparent, and which is written separately]; as in <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a maA Einoka HasanN</foreign> meaning <hi>Verily what is with thee is good,</hi> and in <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a maA faEalota HasanN</foreign> meaning <hi>Verily thy deed is good.</hi> (I' Ak pp. 97 and 98.) ―         -b7-  <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a</foreign> is sometimes contracted into <foreign lang="ar">A_inN</foreign>; (S, Mughnee, K;) and in this case, it is made to govern and is made to have no government: (S:) it is seldom made to govern in this case; often made to have no government: the Koofees say that it is not contracted; (Mughnee, K;) and that when one says, <foreign lang="ar">A_ino zayodN lamunoTaliqN</foreign> [the meaning is virtually <hi>Verily Zeyd is going away,</hi> but] <foreign lang="ar">A_inN</foreign> is a negative and the <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign> is syn. with <foreign lang="ar">A_il~A</foreign>; but this assertion is refuted by the fact that some make it to govern when contracted, as in exs. cited above, voce <foreign lang="ar">A_ino</foreign>, q. v.

                  <foreign lang="ar">ka*`lika</foreign> [<hi>Verily it,</hi> i. e. <hi>the case, is thus</hi>]. (Mughnee.) [J says,] The meaning is, <foreign lang="ar">A_n~ahu qado kaAna kamaA</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">taqulona</foreign> [<hi>Verily it,</hi> i. e. <hi>the case, hath been as ye say</hi>]: A 'Obeyd says, This is a curtailment of the speech of the Arabs; the pronoun being deemed sufficient because the meaning is known: and as to the saying of Akh, that it signifies <foreign lang="ar">naEamo</foreign>, he only means thereby that it may be so rendered, not that it is originally applied to that signification: he says that the <foreign lang="ar">h</foreign> is here added to denote the pause. (S.) There is, however, a good ex. of <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a</foreign> in the sense of <foreign lang="ar">naEamo</foreign> in the saying of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr, to him who said to him, “May God curse a she camel which carried me to thee,” <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a waraAkibahaA</foreign>, i. e. <hi>Even so,</hi> or <hi>yes,</hi> or <hi>yea;</hi> and may God curse <hi>her rider:</hi> for the suppression of both the subject and the predicate is not allowable. (Mughnee.) And hence, accord. to Mbr, the saying in the Kur [xx. 66], as thus read, <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a</foreign>

                  <hi>enchanters</hi>]. (Mughnee.) [But this phrase has given rise to much discussion, related in the Mughnee and other works. The following is a brief abstract of what has been said respecting it by several of the leading authorities.] A booIs-hák says that the people of El-Medeeneh and El-Koofeh read as above, except 'Ásim, who is reported to have read, <foreign lang="ar">A_inN h`*aAni</foreign>, without tesh-deed, and so is Kh; [so too is Hafs, as is said above, voce <foreign lang="ar">A_ino</foreign>;] and that AA read <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a h`*yoni</foreign>, the former word with teshdeed, and the latter in the accus. case: that the argument for <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a h`*aAni</foreign>, with teshdeed and the nom. case, [or rather what is identical in form with the nom. case,] is, that it is of the dial. of Kináneh, in which the dual is formed by the termination <foreign lang="ar">An</foreign> in the nom. and accus. and gen. cases alike, as also in the dial. of Benu-l-Hárith Ibn-Kaab: but that the old grammarians say that <foreign lang="ar">h</foreign> is here suppressed; the meaning being, <foreign lang="ar">A_in~ahu h`*aAni</foreign>: (T:) this last assertion, however, is weak; for what is applied to the purpose of corroboration should not be suppressed, and the instances of its suppression which have been heard are deviations from general usage, except in the case of <foreign lang="ar">A^an~a</foreign>, with fet-h, contracted into <foreign lang="ar">A^ano</foreign>: (Mughnee:) Aboo-Is-hák then adds, that some say, <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a</foreign> is here syn. with <foreign lang="ar">naEamo</foreign>: this last opinion he holds to be the best; the meaning being, <foreign lang="ar">naEamo h`*aAni lahumaA saAHiraAni</foreign> [<hi>Yes, these two, verily they are two enchanters:</hi> for this is not a case in which the <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign> (which is the <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign> of inception) can be regarded as transferred from its proper place, at the commencement of the sentence or proposition, as it is in some instances mentioned in the former half of this paragraph: but it is said in the Mughnee that this explanation is invalidated by the fact that the combining of the corroborative <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign> and the suppression of the inchoative is like the combining of two things inconsistent, or incompatible; as is also the opinion that the <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign> is redundant, because the redundant <foreign lang="ar">l</foreign> prefixed to the enunciative is peculiar to poetry]: next in point of goodness, in the opinion of A booIs-hák, is, that it is of the dial. of Kináneh and Benu-l-Hárith Ibn-Kaab: the reading of AA he does not allow, because it is at variance with the written text: but he approves the reading of 'Ásim and Kh. (T.)       -A2-  <foreign lang="ar">A_in~a</foreign> also occurs as a verb: it is the third person pl. fem. of the pret. from <foreign lang="ar">AlA^ayonu</foreign>, syn. with <foreign lang="ar">Alt~aEabu</foreign>; or from <foreign lang="ar">A=na</foreign> syn. with <foreign lang="ar">qaruba</foreign>: or the third person sing. masc. of the pret. passive from <foreign lang="ar">AlA^anyinu</foreign>, in the dial. of those who, for <foreign lang="ar">rud~a</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">Hub~a</foreign>, say <foreign lang="ar">rid~a</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">Hib~a</foreign>, likening these verbs to <foreign lang="ar">qiyla</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">biyEa</foreign>: or the sing. masc. of the imperative from the same: or the pl. fem. of the imperative from <foreign lang="ar">AlA^ayonu</foreign>; or from <foreign lang="ar">A=na</foreign> syn. with <foreign lang="ar">qaruba</foreign>: or the sing. fem. of the corroborated form of the imperative from <foreign lang="ar">waA^aY</foreign>, syn. with <foreign lang="ar">waEada</foreign>.

                  </form> a conjunction, (M, Mughnee, K,) to which the later authors have ascribed meanings amounting to twelve: (Mughnee:) a particle which, when occurring in an enunciative phrase, [generally] denotes doubt, and vagueness of meaning; and when occurring in an imperative or a prohibitive phrase, [generally] denotes the giving of option, or choice, and the allowing a thing, or making it allowable. (S.) ―         -b2-  First, (Mughnee,) it denotes doubt. (T, S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K.) So in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">raA^ayotu zayodFA A^awo EamorFA</foreign> [<hi>I saw Zeyd or 'Amr</hi>]. (T, * S, Msb.) And <foreign lang="ar">jaA=niY rajulN A^awi A@moraA^apN</foreign> [<hi>A man or a woman came to me</hi>]. (Mbr, T.) And <foreign lang="ar">labiy^onaA yawomFA A^awo baEoDa yawomK</foreign> [in the Kur xviii. 18 and xxiii. 115, <hi>We have remained a day or part of a day</hi>]. (Mughnee.) ―         -b3-  Secondly, (Mughnee,) it denotes vagueness of meaning. (S, Msb, Mughnee, K.) S [it may be used] in the first of the .exs. given above. (Msb.) And so in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">waA^an~aA A^awo A_iy~aAkumo laEalaY hudFy A^awo fiY DalaAlK mubiynK</foreign> [<hi>And verily we or ye are following a right direction or in manifest error</hi>], (S, Mughnee,) in the Kur [xxxiv. 23]; (S;) the ex. being in the former <foreign lang="ar">Aw</foreign>. (Mughnee.) ―         -b4-  Thirdly, (Mughnee,) it denotes the giving of option, or choice. (T, S, M, Mughnee, K.) So in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">kuli Als~amaka A^awi A@$orabi</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">All~abana</foreign> [<hi>Eat thou the fish, or drink thou the milk</hi>]; i. e. do not thou both of these actions; (Mbr, T, S;) but choose which of them thou wilt. (Mbr, T.) And <foreign lang="ar">tazaw~ajo hinodFA A^awo A^uxotahaA</foreign> [<hi>Take thou as wife Hind or her sister</hi>]. (Mughnee.) And [in like manner] it denotes the making choice. (T.) [So when you say, <foreign lang="ar">saA^atazaw~aju hinodFA A^awo A^uxotahaA</foreign>, meaning <hi>I will take as wife Hind or her sister;</hi> whichever of them I choose.] ―         -b5-  Fourthly, (Mughnee,) it denotes the allowing a thing, or making it allowable. (T, S, Msb, Mughnee, K.) So in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">jaAlisi Hasana A^awi A@bona siyriyna</foreign> [<hi>Sit thou with El- Hasan or Ibn-Seereen</hi>]. (Mbr, T, S.) And <foreign lang="ar">qumo A^awi A@qoEudo</foreign> [<hi>Stand thou or sit</hi>]: and the person to whom this is said may do [one or] both of the se actions. (Msb.) [And similar exs. are given in the Mughnee.]) But <foreign lang="ar">walaA tuTiEo minohumo A=vimFA</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">A^aw kafuwrFA</foreign> [in the Kur lxxvi. 24, <hi>And obey not thou, of them, a sinner or a person very ungrateful to God,</hi>] means that thou shalt not obey either of such persons: (Mbr, T, Mughnee:) in which case <foreign lang="ar">Aw</foreign> is more forcible than <foreign lang="ar">wa</foreign>; for when you say to a person, <foreign lang="ar">laA tuTiEo zayodFA waEamorFA</foreign> [<hi>Obey not thou Zeyd and 'Amr</hi>], he may obey one of them, since the command is that he shall not obey the two. (Zj, T.) ―         -b6-  Fifthly, (Mughnee,) it denotes unrestricted conjunction. (Mughnee, K.) So in the saying, in the Kur [iv. 46 and v. 9], <foreign lang="ar">A^awo jaA='a</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">A^aHadN minokumo mina AlgaAy^iTi</foreign> [<hi>And</hi> if <hi>any one of you cometh from the privy</hi>]; (TA;) [where, however, it may also be rendered <hi>or,</hi> though] meaning <foreign lang="ar">wajaA='a</foreign>; (T, TA;) the <foreign lang="ar">w</foreign> in this explanation being what is termed a denotative of state. (T.) So, too, accord. to AZ, in the expression <foreign lang="ar">A^awo yaziyduwna</foreign> [<hi>And they exceeded</hi> that number], in the Kur [xxxvii. 147]: but see below. (TA.) And so in the words, <foreign lang="ar">A^awo A^ano nafoEala fiY A^amowaAlinaA maA na$aA='u</foreign> [<hi>And our doing, in respect of our possessions, what we will</hi>], in the Kur [xi. 89]. (T, TA.) ―         -b7-  Sixthly, it denotes transition, (Mughnee,) used in the sense of [the adversative particle] <foreign lang="ar">balo</foreign>, (T, S, M, Mughnee, K,) in a case of amplification of speech; (S;) accord. to Sb, on two conditions; that it shall be preceded by a negation or a prohibition, and that the agent shall be mentioned a second time; as in <foreign lang="ar">maA qaAma zayodN A^awo maA qaAma EamorNw</foreign> [<hi>Zeyd did not stand: nay, rather 'Amr did not stand</hi>]; and <foreign lang="ar">laA yaqomN zaydN A^awo laA yaqumo Eamoruw</foreign> [<hi>Let not Zeyd stand: nay, rather let not 'Amr stand</hi>]. (Mughnee.) Accord. to Fr, (Th, M, Mughnee,) it has this meaning in <foreign lang="ar">A^awo yaziyduwna</foreign> [<hi>Nay, rather they exceeded</hi> that number], (Th, S, M, Mughnee,) in the Kur [xxxvii. 147, cited above]: (S:) or the meaning is, <hi>or they would exceed</hi> [that number] in your estimation: or these words with those preceding them in the same verse mean, we sent him to a multitude of whom, if ye saw them, ye would say, They are a hundred thousand, <hi>or they exceed</hi> [that number]; (M, Mughnee; *) so that it denotes doubt on the part of men, not of God, for He is not subject to doubt: (M:) or we sent him to a hundred thousand in the estimation of men, <hi>or they exceeded</hi> [that number] in the estimation of men; for God does not doubt: (S:) or <foreign lang="ar">Aw</foreign> is here used to denote vagueness of meaning: (IB, Mughnee:) or, it is said, to denote that a person might choose between saying, “they are a hundred thousand,“ and saying, “they are more;“ but this may not be when one of the two things is the fact: or, accord. to some of the Koofees, it has the meaning of <foreign lang="ar">wa</foreign>: and each of these meanings, except the last, has been assigned to <foreign lang="ar">Aw</foreign> as occurring in the Kur ii. 69 and xvi. 79. (Mughnee.) ―         -b8-  Seventhly, it denotes division; (Mughnee, K; *) as in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">Alkalimapu A@somN A^awo fiEolN A^awo HarofN</foreign> [<hi>The word is a noun or a verb or a particle</hi>]: so said Ibn-Málik: or, as he afterwards said, in preference, it denotes separation (<foreign lang="ar">Alt~afriyq</foreign>) divested of the attribute of denoting doubt and vagueness of meaning and the giving of option or choice; adducing as one of his exs. of this meaning the saying, <foreign lang="ar">waqaAluwA kuwnuwA huwdFA A^awo naSaAraY</foreign> [in the Kur ii. 129, <hi>And they said, “Be ye Jews” or “Christians”</hi>]; because the use of <foreign lang="ar">w</foreign> in division is better; as when you say, <foreign lang="ar">Alkalimapu A@somN wafiEolN waHarofN</foreign>: or it denotes, accord. to some, distinction (<foreign lang="ar">Alt~afoSiyl</foreign>); and the meaning of the ex. last cited, say they, is, <hi>and the Jews said, “Be ye Jews,” and the Christians said, “Be ye Christians.”</hi> (Mughnee.) It is [said to be] used in this last sense (that of <foreign lang="ar">AltfDyl</foreign>) in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">kunotu A=kulu All~aHoma A^awi AlEasala</foreign> [<hi>I used to eat flesh-meat or honey</hi>]; i. e. <hi>I used to eat flesh-meat one time and honey another time:</hi> and so in the Kur vii. 3 and x. 13. ―         -b9-  Eighthly, (Mughnee,) it is used in the sense of the exceptive <foreign lang="ar">A_il~aA</foreign>, (Mughnee, K,) or <foreign lang="ar">A_il~aA A^ano</foreign> (M;) and in this case the aor. after it is mansoob, because of <foreign lang="ar">A^ano</foreign> suppressed. (Mughnee, K.) So in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">laA^aqotulan~ahu A^awo yusolima</foreign> [<hi>I will assuredly slay him or he shall become a Muslim;</hi> i. e., <hi>unless he become a Muslim</hi>]. (Mughnee. [And a similar ex. is given in the M.]) So, too, in the saying, <quote>

(Mughnee.) ―         -b11-  Tenthly, some say, (Mughnee,) it denotes nearness [of one event or thing to another]; as in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">maA A^adoriY</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">A^asal~ama A^awo wad~aEa</foreign> [<hi>I know not whether he saluted or bade farewell</hi>]: (Mughnee, K: [but in the CK this ex. is misplaced:]) this, however, is manifestly wrong; <foreign lang="ar">Aw</foreign> being here used to denote doubt, and the denoting of nearness being only inferred from the fact of the saluting being confounded in the mind with the bidding farewell, since this is impossible or improbable when the two times are far apart. (Mughnee.) ―         -b12-  Eleventhly, (Mughnee,) it occurs as a conditional, (T, Mughnee, K,) accord. to Ks alone; (T;) or rather as a conjunctive and conditional; <foreign lang="ar">waA_ino</foreign> being meant to be understood in its place; though in truth the verb that precedes it indicates that the conditional particle [<foreign lang="ar">A_ino</foreign>] is meant to be understood [before that verb], and <foreign lang="ar">Aw</foreign> retains its proper character, but forms part of that which has a conditional meaning because conjoined with a preceding conditional phrase. (Mughnee.) So in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">laA^aDoriban~ahu EaA$a A^awo maAta</foreign>, (Mughnee, K,) i. e., <foreign lang="ar">A_ino</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">EaAiD baEoda AlD~arobi wa A_ino maAta</foreign> [<hi>I will assuredly beat him if he live</hi> (after the beating) <hi>or if he die</hi>]: so says Ibn-Esh-Shejeree. (Mughnee.) ―         -b13-  Twelfthly, accord. to Ibn-Esh-Shejeree, on the authority of some one or more of the Koofees, (Mughnee,) it denotes division into parts, or portions; as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 129, before cited,] <foreign lang="ar">waqaAluwA kuwnuwA huwdFA A^aw naSaAraY</foreign>, (Mughnee, K,) i. e. <hi>And they said, “Be ye, some of you, Jews, and, some of you, Christians:</hi>” (TA:) but [IHsh says,] it appears to me that the meaning here is that of <foreign lang="ar">Alt~afoSiyl</foreign> mentioned before. (Mughnee.) ―         -b14-  [In the K it is said to occur also in the sense of <foreign lang="ar">A^ano</foreign>: but this is evidently a mistake, app. originating in one of the two principal sources of the K, namely, the M, in which the same is said, but is exemplified by a phrase in which it is explained by <foreign lang="ar">A_il~aA A^ano</foreign>, the eighth of the meanings of <foreign lang="ar">A^awo</foreign> mentioned above.] ―         -b15-  See also <foreign lang="ar">A^aw~N</foreign> below.    </entryFree>

One of its meanings is that of an interrogative, (T, S, M, Mughnee, K,) relating to intellectual beings and to non-intellectual things; [meaning <hi>Who? which?</hi> and <hi>what?</hi>] (S, M, K;) and as such, it is a decl. noun: (S:) it is said in the K to be a particle; (MF;) and so in the M; (TA;) but this is wrong: (MF:) and it is added in the K that it is indecl.; (MF;) and it is said to be so in the M, accord. to Sb, in an instance to be explained below; (TA;) but this is only when it is a conjunct noun [like <foreign lang="ar">Al~a*iY</foreign>], or denotes the object of a vocative: (MF:) or, accord. to some, it is decl. as a conjunct noun also. (Mughnee.) You say, <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~uhumo A^axuwka</foreign> [<hi>Who,</hi> or <hi>which, of them, is thy brother?</hi>]. (S.) Another ex. is the saying [in the Kur vii. 184, and last verse of lxxvii.], <foreign lang="ar">fabiA^aY~i HadiyvK baEodahu yuw^ominuwna</foreign> [<hi>And in what announcement, after it, will they believe?</hi>]. (Mughnee.) Sometimes it is without teshdeed; as in the saying (of El-Farezdak, M), <quote>

      <orth type="arrow" lang="ar">A^ayo$a</orth> is used as a contraction of <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~u $aYo'K</foreign>. (Ks, TA in art. <foreign lang="ar">jrm</foreign>.) A poet speaks of his companions as being <foreign lang="ar">biA^aYa waA^ayonamaA</foreign>; making <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~</foreign> the name of the quarter (<foreign lang="ar">jihap</foreign>); so that, being determinate and of the feminine gender, it is imperfectly declinable. (M. [See <foreign lang="ar">A^aynN</foreign>; under which head two other readings are given; and where it is said that the verse in which this occurs is by Homeyd Ibn-Thowr.]) <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~</foreign> is never without a noun or pronoun to which it is prefixed, except in a vocative expression and when it is made to conform with a word to which it refers, as in cases to be exemplified hereafter. (Mughnee.) Being so prefixed, it is determinate; but sometimes, [as in the latter of the cases just mentioned,] it is not so prefixed, yet has the meaning of a prefixed noun. (S.) When used as an interrogative, it is not governed, as to the letter, though it is as to the meaning, by the verb that precedes it, but by what follows it; as in the saying in the Kur [xviii. 11], <foreign lang="ar">linaEolama A^aY~u AlHizobayoni</foreign>

(S.) When they separate it [from what follows it, not prefixing it to another noun], the Arabs say <foreign lang="ar">A^aYN</foreign>, and in the dual <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~aAni</foreign>, and in the pl. <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~uwna</foreign>; and they make it fem., saying <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~apN</foreign>, and [in the dual] <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~ataAni</foreign>, and [in the pl.] <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~aAtN</foreign>: but when they prefix it to a noun, properly so called, not a pronoun, they make it sing. and masc., saying <foreign lang="ar">A^aYu Alr~ajulayoni</foreign> [<hi>Who,</hi> or <hi>which, of the two men?</hi>], and <foreign lang="ar">A^aYu AlmaroA^atayoni</foreign> [<hi>Who,</hi> or <hi>which, of the two women?</hi>], and <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~u Al~rijaAli</foreign> [<hi>Who,</hi> or <hi>which, of the men?</hi>], and <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~u Aln~isaA='i</foreign> [<hi>Who,</hi> or <hi>which, of the women?</hi>]: and when they prefix it to a fem. pronoun, they make it masc.

(Bd.) When it is used as an interrogative relating to an indeterminate noun in a preceding phrase, <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~</foreign> is made to conform with that indeterminate noun in case-ending and in gender and in number; and this is done [alike, accord. to some,] in the case of its connexion with a following word and in the case of a pause; so that, [in the case of a pause,] to him who says, <foreign lang="ar">jaA='aniY rajulN</foreign> [A man came to me], you say, [accord. to the authorities alluded to above,] <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~N</foreign> [<hi>Who?</hi>]; and to him who says, <foreign lang="ar">raA^ayotu</foreign>

(I' Ak p. 319.) [Exs. in cases of pause, agreeing with the foregoing rules, are given in the T; and exs. in cases of connexion with following words, agreeing with the foregoing, are given in the Mughnee: but J gives rules differing from the foregoing in some respects; and IB gives rules differing in some points both from the foregoing and from those of J.] It is said in the S, <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~</foreign> is made to conform with indeterminate nouns significant of intellectual beings and of nonintellectual things, and is used as an interrogative; and when it is thus used in reference to an indeterminate noun, you make it to have a caseending like that of the noun respecting which it demands positive information; so that when it is said to you, <foreign lang="ar">mar~abiY rajulN</foreign> [A man passed by me], you say, <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~N yaA fataY</foreign> [<hi>Who, O young man?</hi>], thus giving it a case-ending [like that of <foreign lang="ar">rajulN</foreign>] when it is in connexion with a following word; and you indicate the case-ending [by the pronunciation termed <foreign lang="ar">Alr~awomu</foreign>, saying <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~u</foreign>, with a somewhat obscure utterance of the final vowel,] in pausing; and if one says, <foreign lang="ar">raA^ayotu rajulFA</foreign> [I saw a man], you say, <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~aA yaAfataY</foreign> [<hi>Whom, O young man?</hi>], giving it a case-ending [like that of <foreign lang="ar">rajulFA</foreign>], with tenween, when it is [thus] in connexion with a following word; and you pause upon the <foreign lang="ar">A</foreign>, saying <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~aA</foreign>; and when one says, <foreign lang="ar">mararotu birajulK</foreign> [I passed by a man], you say, <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~K yaAfataY</foreign> [<hi>Whom, O young man?</hi> in a case of connexion with a following word; and <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~i</foreign> in a case of pausing]: you conform with what the other has said, in the nom. and accus. and gen. cases, in the case of connexion with a following word and in that of pausing: but IB says that this is correct only in the case of connexion with a following word; for in the case of a pause, you say only <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~o</foreign>, in the nom. and gen., with sukoon; and you imitate in both of these cases only when you use the dual form or the pl.: it is added in the S, you say in the cases of the dual and pl. and fem. like as we have said respecting <foreign lang="ar">mano</foreign>: when one says, <foreign lang="ar">jaA='aniY rijaAlN</foreign> [Men came to me], you say, <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~uwno</foreign> [<hi>Who?</hi>], with the <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign> quiescent; and <foreign lang="ar">A^ayiyno</foreign> in the accus. and gen.: but IB says, the correct <pb n="133"/> mode is to say, <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~uwna</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~ina</foreign>, with fet-h to the <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign> in both; [meaning that this is the only allowable mode in the case of connexion with a following word, and app. that it is the preferable mode in the case of a pause;] the quiescent <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign> being allowable only in the case of a pause, and with respect to <foreign lang="ar">mano</foreign>, for you say <foreign lang="ar">manuwno</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">maniyno</foreign> with the quiescent <foreign lang="ar">n</foreign> only: it is then added in the S, you say, also, <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~aho</foreign> [<hi>Who?</hi> and <hi>whom?</hi>] in using the fem. [in a case of pause]; but in a case of connexion with a following word, [when referring to a noun in the accus.,] you say, <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~apF</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">yaA h`*aA</foreign> [<hi>Whom, O thou?</hi> in the sing.], and <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~aAtK</foreign> [in the pl.; and in like manner, <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~apN</foreign> in the nom. sing., and <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~apK</foreign> in the gen. sing.; and <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~aAtN</foreign> in the nom. pl., and <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~aAtK</foreign> in the gen. pl.]: but when the interrogation refers to a determinate noun, <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~</foreign> is in the nom. case (with refa) only. (TA.) [See also <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~aAna</foreign>, below.] ―         -b2-  [In other cases, now to be mentioned, it is used alike as sing., dual, and pl.] ―         -b3-  It also denotes a condition; (T, S, M, Mughnee;) in which case, also, it is a decl. noun, applied to an intellectual being and to a non-intellectual thing. (S.) So in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~uhumo yukorimoniY A^ukorimohu</foreign> [<hi>Whichever of them treats me with honour, I will treat him with honour</hi>]. (S.) So, too, in the saying [in the Kur xvii. 110], <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~FA maA tadoEuwA falahu</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">AlA^asomaA='u AlHusonaY</foreign> [<hi>Whichever ye call</hi> Him, <hi>He hath the best names</hi>]. (T, * Mughnee.) And in the saying [in the same, xxviii. 28], <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~amaA A@loA^ajalayoni</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">qaDayotu falaA EudowaAna EalaY~a</foreign> [<hi>Whichever of the two terms I fulfil, there shall be no wrongdoing to me</hi>]. (Mughnee.) One says also, <foreign lang="ar">SaHibahu A@ll~`hu A^ay~aA</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">maA tawaj~aha</foreign>, meaning <foreign lang="ar">A^ayonamaAtawaj~aha</foreign> [<hi>May God accompany him wherever he goeth</hi>]. (AZ, T.) And Zuheyr uses the expression <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~apF salakuwA</foreign> for <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~apa wijohapK</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">salakuwA</foreign> [<hi>Whatever tract they travelled,</hi> or <hi>travel</hi>]. (T.) The saying, <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~iY waA^ay~uka kaAna $ar~aA faA^axozaAhu A@ll~`hu</foreign> [<hi>Whichever of me and thee be evil, may God abase him !</hi>] was explained by Kh to Sb as meaning <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~unaA kaAna $ar~FA</foreign> [<hi>whichever of us two be evil</hi>]; and as being like the saying, <foreign lang="ar">A^axozaY A@ll~`hu AlkaA*iba</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">miniY~ waminoka</foreign>, meaning <foreign lang="ar">min~aA</foreign>. (M. [And in a similar manner, the former clause of that saying, occurring in a verse, with <foreign lang="ar">maA</foreign> after <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~iY</foreign>, is said in the T to have been explained by Kh to Sb.]) ―         -b4-  It is also a conjunct noun; (Mughnee;) [i. e.] it is sometimes used in the manner of <foreign lang="ar">Al~a*iY</foreign>, and therefore requires a complement; as in the saying, <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~uhumo fiY Ald~aAri A^axuwka</foreign> [<hi>He, of them, who is in the house is thy brother</hi>]: (S:) [i. e.] it is syn. with <foreign lang="ar">Al~a*iY</foreign>. (M, Mughnee.) So in the saying [in the Kur xix. 70], <foreign lang="ar">vum~a lananoziEan~a mino kul~i $iyEapK A^ay~uhumo A^a$ad~u</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">EalaY Alr~aHom`ni Eutiy~aA</foreign> [<hi>Then we will assuredly draw forth, from every sect, him, of them, who is most exorbitantly rebellious against the Compassionate</hi>]: so says Sb: but the Koofees and a number of the Basrees disagree with him, holding that the conjunct noun <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~</foreign> is always decl., like the conditional and the interrogative: Zj says, “It has not appeared to me that Sb has erred except in two instances, whereof this is one; for he has conceded that it is decl. when separate, and how can he say that it is indecl. when it is a prefixed noun?” and El-Jarmee says, “I have gone forth from El-Basrah, and have not heard, from my leaving the Khandak to Mekkeh, any one say, <foreign lang="ar">laA^aDoriban~a A^ay~uhumo qaAy^imN</foreign> [as meaning <hi>I will assuredly beat him, of them, who is standing</hi>], with damm:” these assert, that it is, in the verse above, an interrogative, and that it is an inchoative, and <foreign lang="ar">A$d</foreign> is an enunciative: but they differ as to the objective complement of the verb: Kh says that this is suppressed, and that the implied meaning is, <hi>we will assuredly draw forth those of whom it will be said, Which of them is most</hi> &amp;c.? and Yoo says that it is the proposition [<foreign lang="ar">Ayh~m</foreign> &amp;c.], and that the verb is suspended from governing, as in the instance in the Kur xviii. 11, cited above: and Ks and Akh say that it is <foreign lang="ar">kl~ $yEp</foreign>, that <foreign lang="ar">mn</foreign> is redundant, and that the interrogative proposition is independent of what precedes it; this being grounded on their saying that the redundance of <foreign lang="ar">mino</foreign> is allowable in an affirmative proposition: but these [following] facts refute their sayings; viz. that the suspension of government is peculiar to verbs significant of operations of the mind; and that it is not allowable to say, <foreign lang="ar">laA^aDoriban~a AlfaAsiqu</foreign>, with refa, as meaning by implication “I will assuredly beat him of whom it is said, He is the transgressor;” and that the redundance of <foreign lang="ar">mino</foreign> in an affirmative proposition is not correct. (Mughnee. [Some further remarks on the same subject, in that work, mentioning other opinions as erroneous, I omit. Another reading of the passage in the Kur cited above (xix. 70) will be found in what here follows.]) [ISd states that] they said, <foreign lang="ar">laA^aDorban~a A^ay~uhumo A^afoDalu</foreign> [<hi>I will assuredly beat him, of them, who is most excellent</hi>], and <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~N A^afoDalu</foreign> [<hi>him who is most excel-lent</hi>]; <foreign lang="ar">AY~</foreign> being indecl., accord. to Sb, and therefore the verb does not govern it [save as to the meaning]. (M.) And [that] you say, <foreign lang="ar">AiDoribo A^ay~uhumo</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">A^afoDalu</foreign> [<hi>Beat thou him, of them, who is most excellent</hi>], and <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~ahumo A^afoDalu</foreign> [meaning the same, or <hi>whichever of them,</hi> &amp;c.]; suppressing the relative <foreign lang="ar">huwa</foreign> after <foreign lang="ar">Ay~hm</foreign>. (M in a later part of the same art.) Fr says that when <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~</foreign> is governed by the verb before it, it has not the interrogative meaning; and you may say, <foreign lang="ar">laA^aDoriban~a A^ay~ahumo yaquwlu *`lika</foreign> [<hi>I will assuredly beat him, of them,</hi> or <hi>whichever of them, says that</hi>]: and he says that he who reads <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~ahumo</foreign>, in the accus. case, in the passage of the Kur cited above (xix. 70) makes it to be governed by <foreign lang="ar">lananoriEan~a</foreign>. (T.) Ks says, you say, <foreign lang="ar">laA^aDoriban~a A^ay~ahumo fiY Ald~aAri</foreign> [<hi>I will assuredly beat him, of them,</hi> or <hi>whichever of them, is in the house</hi>]; but you may not say, <foreign lang="ar">Darabotu A^ay~ahumo fiY Ald~aAri</foreign>: thus he distinguishes between the actual occurrence and that which is expected. (S.) Akh says, also, that it may be indeterminate and qualified by an epithet; as when one says, <foreign lang="ar">mararotu biA^aY~K</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">muEojibK laka</foreign>, like as one says, <foreign lang="ar">bimano muEojibK laka</foreign> [<hi>I passed by one pleasing to thee</hi>]: but this has not been heard [from the Arabs]. (Mughnee.) ―         -b5-  It also denotes perfection, or consummateness: and in this case it is an epithet applying to an indeterminate noun; as in <foreign lang="ar">zayodN rajulN A^aY~u rajulK</foreign> (tropical:) [<hi>Zeyd is a man; what a man!</hi>], meaning that he is complete, or consummate, in the qualities of men: and it is a denotative of state relating to a determinate noun; as in <foreign lang="ar">mararotu biEabodi A@ll~`hi A^aY~a rajulK</foreign> (tropical:) [<hi>I passed by 'Abd-Allah; what a man was he!</hi>]: (Mughnee:) and used in this sense, it is tropical. (Har p. 534.) [J says,] it is sometimes an epithet applying to an indeterminate noun: you say, <foreign lang="ar">mararotu birajulK A^aY~i rajulK</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~imaArajulK</foreign> (assumed tropical:) [<hi>I passed by a man; what a man!</hi>]; and <foreign lang="ar">mararotu biA@moraA^apK A^ay~api A@moraA^apK</foreign> (assumed tropical:) [<hi>I passed by a woman; what a woman!</hi>], and <foreign lang="ar">biA@moraA^atayoni A^ay~atimaA A@moraA^atayoni</foreign> [<hi>by two women; what two women!</hi>]; and <foreign lang="ar">h`*ihi A@moraA^apN A^ay~apu A@moraA^apK</foreign> (assumed tropical:) [<hi>This is a woman; what a woman!</hi>]: and <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~atumaA A@moraA^a A^ay~apu A@moraA^apK</foreign> (assumed tropical:) [<hi>What two women!</hi>]; <foreign lang="ar">mA</foreign> being redundant: and in the case of a determinate noun, you say, <foreign lang="ar">h`*aA</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">zayodN A^ay~amaA rajulK</foreign> (assumed tropical:) [<hi>This is Zeyd; what a man is he!</hi>]; putting it in the accus. case as a denotative of state; and <foreign lang="ar">h`*ihi A^amapu A@ll~`hi A^ay~atamaA jaAriy~pK</foreign> (assumed tropical:)  [<hi>This is the handmaid of God; what a girl,</hi> or <hi>young woman, is she!</hi>]: you say, also, [in using an indeterminate noun,] <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~u A@moraA^apK jaA='atoka</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">jaA='aka</foreign>, and <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~apu A@moraA^apK jaA='atoka</foreign> (assumed tropical:)  [<hi>What a woman came to thee!</hi>]; and <foreign lang="ar">mararotu bijaAriyapK A^aY~i jaAriyapK</foreign> (assumed tropical:)  [<hi>I passed by a girl,</hi> or <hi>young woman; what a girl,</hi> or <hi>young woman!</hi>]; and <foreign lang="ar">jiy^otuka bimulaA='apK A^aY~i mulaA='apK</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~api mulaA='ipK</foreign> (assumed tropical:)  [<hi>I brought thee a body-wrapper; what a body-wrapper!</hi>]: all are allowable.

[In all these it evidently denotes admiration, or wonder, at some good or extraordinary quality in the person or thing to which it relates; notwithstanding that J says afterwards,] and sometimes it is used to denote wonder; as in the saying of Jemeel, <quote>

(S.) Kh says that if any one of the Arabs made it to govern the gen. case, perhaps he did so by making <foreign lang="ar">mino</foreign> to be implied, as is allowable with <foreign lang="ar">kamo</foreign>: (M:) [so that you may say, <foreign lang="ar">bikaA^ay~ino dirohamK</foreign>

                  <hi>For how many a dirhem didst thou buy this?</hi> for] it is allowable to make the noun that follows <foreign lang="ar">kamo</foreign> to be governed in the gen. case by <foreign lang="ar">mno</foreign> implied, when <foreign lang="ar">km</foreign> immediately follows a preposition; as in <foreign lang="ar">bikDmo dirohamK A@$otarayota h`*aA</foreign>; but when it is not thus preceded by a preposition, the noun after it must be in the accus. case. (I 'Ak p. 317.) It always holds the first place in a proposition, like <foreign lang="ar">kamo</foreign>. (Idem, next p.) ―         -b7-  It is also a connective of the vocative <foreign lang="ar">yaA</foreign> with the noun signifying the person or persons or thing called, when this noun has the article <foreign lang="ar">Al</foreign> prefixed to it; (S, M, Mughnee, K;) and with a noun of indication, as <foreign lang="ar">*aA</foreign>; and with a conjunct noun having <foreign lang="ar">Al</foreign> prefixed to it, as <foreign lang="ar">Al*~iY</foreign>: (I 'Ak p. 268:) it is a noun formed for serving as such a connective; (M, K;) and has <foreign lang="ar">haA</foreign> affixed to it. (S, M, &amp;c.) You say, <foreign lang="ar">yaA A^ay~uhaA Alr~ajulu</foreign> [which seems to be best rendered <hi>O thou man;</hi> more agreeably with the original, <hi>O thou, the man;</hi> or, accord. to Akh, <hi>O thou who art the man;</hi> lit., <hi>O he who is the man;</hi> often written <foreign lang="ar">yaA^ay~uhaA</foreign>]; (T, S, M, Mughnee, K;) and <foreign lang="ar">yaAA^ay~uhaA Alr~ajulaAni</foreign> [<hi>O ye two men</hi>]; and <foreign lang="ar">yaAA^ay~uhaA Alr~ijaAlu</foreign> [<hi>O ye men</hi>]; (M;) and <foreign lang="ar">yaAA^ay~atuhaAAlmaroA^apu</foreign> [<hi>O thou woman</hi>]; (S, M;) and <foreign lang="ar">yaA A^ay~atuhaA AlmaroA^ataAni</foreign> [<hi>O ye two women</hi>]; and <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~atuhaA Aln~sowapu</foreign> [<hi>O ye women</hi>]; and <foreign lang="ar">yaAA^ay~uhaA AlmaroA^apu</foreign>, and <foreign lang="ar">AlmaroA^ataAni</foreign>, and <foreign lang="ar">Aln~isowapu</foreign>; (M;) and <foreign lang="ar">yaAA^ay~uhaA *aA</foreign> [<hi>O thou, this</hi> person or thing]; and <foreign lang="ar">yaA A^ay~uhaA Al~a*iY faEala ka*aA</foreign> [<hi>O thou who didst,</hi> or <hi>hast done, thus</hi>]. (I 'Ak p. 267.) In the first of the exs. here given, <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~</foreign> is a noun of vague signification, (Zj, T, S,) denoting the person called, (Zj, T,) of the sing. number, (Zj, T, S,) rendered determinate by the vocative [<foreign lang="ar">yA</foreign>], (S,) indecl., with damm for its termination; (Zj, T, S;) and <foreign lang="ar">haA</foreign> is a particle employed to rouse attention, or to give notice, a substitute for the noun to which <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~</foreign> is in other cases prefixed; and <foreign lang="ar">Alr~ajulu</foreign> is a qualificative to <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~</foreign>, (Zj, T, S,) wherefore it is in the nom. case. (S.) Akh asserts, [as we have indicated above,] that <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~</foreign> is here the conjunct noun, and that the first member of its complement, namely the relative <foreign lang="ar">huwa</foreign>, is suppressed; the meaning being, <foreign lang="ar">yaA mano huwa Alr~ajulu</foreign>: but this assertion is refuted by the fact that there is no relative pronoun that must be suppressed, nor any conjunct noun that necessarily requires that its complement should be a nominal proposition: though he might reply to these two objections by arguing that <foreign lang="ar">mA</foreign> in the saying <foreign lang="ar">laA siy~amaA zayodN</foreign> is in like manner [virtually] in the nom. case [as a conjunct noun syn. with <foreign lang="ar">Al~a*iY</foreign>, and that the first member of its complement, namely <foreign lang="ar">huwa</foreign>, an inchoative of which <foreign lang="ar">zayodN</foreign> is the enunciative, is suppressed]. (Mughnee.) The putting of the qualificative of <foreign lang="ar">A^aY~</foreign> in the accus. case, as in the saying <foreign lang="ar">yaA A^ay~uhaA Alr~ajula</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">A^aqobilo</foreign> [<hi>O thou man, advance</hi>], is allowed (M, K) by El-Mázinee; but it is not known [as heard from the Arabs]. (M.) <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~uhaA</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">A^ay~atuhaA</foreign> are also used for the purpose of particularizing; [in which case they are not preceded by <foreign lang="ar">yA</foreign>;] as when one says, <foreign lang="ar">A^am~aA A^anaA faA^afoEalu ka*aA A^ay~uhaA Alr~ajulu</foreign> [<hi>As for me, I will do thus,</hi> or <hi>such a thing, thou man</hi>], meaning himself; and as in the saying of Kaab Ibn-Málik, related in a trad., <foreign lang="ar">fataxal~afonaA A^ay~atuhaA Alv~alaAvahu</foreign> [<hi>And we remained behind,</hi> or <hi>held back, ye three</hi>], meaning, by the three, those particularized as remaining behind [with him], or holding back.

                  <hi>Thee I beat,</hi> or <hi>struck,</hi>] they are supported by <foreign lang="ar">AyA</foreign>, and the whole becomes as one thing: (S:) and you may also say, <foreign lang="ar">Darabotu A_iy~aAYa</foreign> [<hi>I beat,</hi> or <hi>struck, me</hi>]; because it is not allowable to say, <foreign lang="ar">DarabotuniY</foreign>: (S as corrected by IB:) but you may not say, <foreign lang="ar">Darabotu A_iy~aAka</foreign> [<hi>I beat,</hi> or <hi>struck, thee</hi>]; because you only require <foreign lang="ar">Ay~Ak</foreign> when you cannot use the <foreign lang="ar">k</foreign> [alone]; though you may say, <foreign lang="ar">Darabotuka A_iy~Aka</foreign> [<hi>I beat,</hi> or <hi>struck, thee, thee</hi>]; because the <foreign lang="ar">k</foreign> is made to be syntactically dependent upon the verb, so when you repeat it you require <foreign lang="ar">Ay~A</foreign>.

                  </quote> [<hi>As though we, on the day of Kurrà, only killed ourselves</hi>], he has separated it from the verb only because the Arabs do not make the action of the agent to fall upon the agent itself by the adjunction of the pronoun: they do not say, <foreign lang="ar">qatalotuniY</foreign>, but only <foreign lang="ar">qatalotu nafosiY</foreign>: so the poet has used <foreign lang="ar">Ay~AnA</foreign> in the same manner as <foreign lang="ar">A^anofusanaA</foreign>. (S, TA.) Some of the grammarians say that <foreign lang="ar">A_iy~aA</foreign> is prefixed to what follows it, governing it in the gen. case; and adduce as an evidence thereof a saying which see below, commencing with <foreign lang="ar">A_i*aA balaga Alr~ajulu</foreign>. (S.) <pb n="136"/> Zj says that it is an explicit noun, [not a pronoun,] which is prefixed to all the pronouns, governing them in the gen. case; but only to pronouns; so that if one said, <foreign lang="ar">A_iy~aA zayodK Had~avotu</foreign>, it would be bad. (M.) Kh holds that it is a pronoun prefixed to the <foreign lang="ar">k</foreign> [&amp;c.], governing it in the gen. case; (M, K;) and the like is related to have been the opinion of El-Mázinee: and Sb relates of Kh that he said, if any one were to say <foreign lang="ar">A_iy~aAka</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">nafosaka</foreign> [<hi>Thee, thyself</hi>], I would not severely blame him, for this <foreign lang="ar">k</foreign> is [virtually] governed in the gen. case. (M.) But accord. to Akh, it is a simple, or uncompounded, pronoun, the ending of which becomes altered, as the endings of pronouns are wont to become, because of the varying of the numbers of the persons using them; (M, K; [in both of which the last of the word thus rendered is <foreign lang="ar">AlmDmryn</foreign>; accord. to a copy of the M, <foreign lang="ar">AlmDmryn</foreign>, i. e. <foreign lang="ar">AlmuDomiryna</foreign>; in a copy of the K, without any syll. signs; and in the CK, <foreign lang="ar">AlmuDomarayoni</foreign>; of which readings, I have followed that found in the M; supposing the meaning to be, that <foreign lang="ar">Ay~A</foreign> has different endings according as it is used by one speaking to another, or by one speaking of another, or by one speaking of himself, or to, or of, two or more, and the like;]) and the <foreign lang="ar">k</foreign> of <foreign lang="ar">Ay~aAk</foreign> is like the <foreign lang="ar">k</foreign> of <foreign lang="ar">*`lika</foreign>, inasmuch as it is an indication of allocution only, divested of the idea of its being a sign of the pronoun. (M.) Of all these varying opinions, IJ says that he has found none to be correct when investigated, except that of Akh; with whose opinion, that stated in the begining of this art. is identical [except as to the affix, which is there said to be a pronoun, not merely a particle of allocution]. (M, TA.) Zj, being asked to explain the meaning of the phrase <foreign lang="ar">A_iy~aAka naEobudu</foreign>, [in the Kur i. 4,] answered, <foreign lang="ar">Haqiytataka naEobudu</foreign> [<hi>Thine essence we worship</hi>]; and said that it is derived from <foreign lang="ar">A=yapN</foreign>, meaning “a sign by which a thing is known:” but IJ does not approve of this. (M.)

(ISk, S.) Ibn-Es-Seree says, When you say, <foreign lang="ar">A_iyhi yaA rajulu</foreign>, you only command him to tell you more of the subject of discourse known to you and him, as though you said, <foreign lang="ar">haAti AlHadiyva</foreign> [<hi>Give,</hi> or <hi>relate, the story,</hi> or <hi>narrative, O man</hi>]: but if you say, <foreign lang="ar">A_iyhK</foreign>, with tenween, it is as though you said, <foreign lang="ar">haAti HadiyvFA m~aA</foreign> [<hi>Give,</hi> or <hi>relate, some story</hi> or <hi>narrative</hi>], because the tenween renders indeterminate: and Dhu-rRummeh meant the tenween, but omitted it through necessity. (S.) As says that Dhu-rRummeh has committed a mistake; the expression of the Arabs being only <foreign lang="ar">A_iyhK</foreign> [in a case of this kind]: ISd says, the truth is, that it is without tenween when determinate, and with tenween when indeterminate; and that Dhu-r-Rummeh asks the ruins to tell him more of a known story, as though he said, <hi>Relate to us the story,</hi> or <hi>tell us the tidings:</hi> (TA:) Aboo-Bekr Ibn-Es-Sarráj says, citing this verse, that <foreign lang="ar">Ayh</foreign> is not known in a case of this kind without tenween in any of the dialects; meaning that it is never conjoined with a following word unless it be with tenween.
